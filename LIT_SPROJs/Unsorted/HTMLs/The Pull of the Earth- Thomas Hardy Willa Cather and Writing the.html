They circle mostly around the two entities that I see as often engaged with each other: </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y86 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">the land and the self. Land, as used in this project, means literally the “solid surfaces of the </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y87 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">earth” and the various things that grow out of it, the texture of hills and fields and prairies. It is </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y88 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">both the literal dirt of the ground and the spreading out space of it. Topos is Greek for place, and </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y89 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">it is a word that runs beneath most of our language around land and home. A literary topos is a </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y8a ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">standard way of organizing rhetoric, it is the often repeated unit of an argument, or of a novel. </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y8b ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">Place can be a figure for this unit of transmission, this repeated and stationary tradition of saying </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y70 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">something, or telling something in a way that is clear and bounded. It is an order and a way of </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y41 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">building from one thing to the next in an expected fashion. Hardy and Cather, however, are </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y8c ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">interested instead in creating a “topography”, a written place. If in rhetoric place is merely the </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y98 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">unit, here it is underlying, running throughout. It is not place as a boxed meaning, but place as a </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y99 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">thing being written, as the act of seeing, feeling, creating a new map of what is there. Places </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y9a ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">here, function as modes of expression, or what Raymond Williams calls “structures of feeling,” </div><div class="t m0 x4 he y9b ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">in his book <span class="ff8">The Country and the City.</span> (13) Topos here, then, is the language and structure of </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y9c ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">your home, both the literal land itself and the words and ways of being that are attached to it. </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y62 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">Topophilia, literally “love of place”, is the line of connection between person and environment. </div><div class="t m0 x4 he y9d ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">As Yi-Fu Taun writes in his introduction to <span class="ff8">Topophilia: A Study of Environmental Perception, </span></div><div class="t m0 x4 he y9e ff8 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">Attitudes and Values, <span class="ff6">it can be defined “broadly to include all of the human being’s affective ties </span></div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y9 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">with the material environment.” (93) These ties, he continues, can be tangible, and aesthetic, or </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y9f ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">“more permanent and less easy to express”, the ties between a human and the place they are </div></div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>

It is both the </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y86 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">physical parts and pieces of a human body (arms, legs, hands), and the unnamed interiority of a </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y87 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">single character. In the anxiety of death and dissolution, there is an equally intense interest in the </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y88 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">idea of wholeness – of a person that is complete within their own body, that has and follows their </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y89 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">own will, that cannot be swamped by a world too big or spread out by the speed of the train; it is </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y8a ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">a desire to be “complete in itself”. In the desire, and attention to, this “whole” self, there is an </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y8b ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">intense attention as well to the territory between the land and the space of the human body. A </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y70 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">person’s true quality, Hardy argues, can “only be approximated by putting together a movement </div><div class="t m0 x4 he y41 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">now and a glance then”. (<span class="ff8">Woodlanders</span>, 36) To make a whole you have to piece together the not-</div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y8c ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">whole. As much as these processes are processes of reading, of working, of walking into land, </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y98 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">they are also processes of holding. Holding history, holding memory, holding the marks of the </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y99 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">world on your skin, holding all the bits and pieces of yourself in one seeming whole. Words, so </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y9a ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">discrete and separate, and the land, so far-away seeming, and the pieces of yourself, so in danger </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y9b ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">of disappearing, must be “grasped, or carried, or supported with your hands.” Writing, I would </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y9c ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">suggest, allows for this holding; a binding together of the discrete and separate into something </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y62 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">larger and more whole.  </div><div class="t m0 x13 hd y93 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">A project based around processes of being, or the individual relationship between a </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y94 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">person and the ground, does not lend itself immediately to historical study.

Most important to my approach has been a combination of phenomenological and </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y97 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">narratological criticism; or the study of the individual experience of the world or the book. I </div><div class="t m0 x4 he ya0 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">turned first to Jonathon Bate’s <span class="ff8">The Song of the Earth</span>, which centers around “the capacity of the </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y18 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">writer to restore us to the earth which is our home.” (vii) He takes much of his own reading of </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y1a ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">“dwelling” in the world through poetry from Martin Heidegger, and he writes that for Heidegger, </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y1c ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">and for himself, “we achieve being not when we represent the world, … but when we stand in a </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y1e ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">site, open to its being, when we are thrown or called. The site is then gathered into a whole for </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y20 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">which we take insistent care…” (261) The “being” that I return to is something akin to this </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y21 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">placedness and openness – it is the process not of representation, but instead of standing, or </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y22 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">walking, or building into a site and then trying to gather it back to yourself. (161) Dwelling and </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y23 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">being are a “presencing”, they bring the individual into a direct, and changing, and unfixed, </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y24 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">relationship with place and land – while both may partake of memory it is a memory that exists </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y25 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">within the body and within, therefore, the present. (262) Bate also often turns to Gaston </div><div class="t m0 x4 he ya1 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">Bachelard’s <span class="ff8">The Poetics of Space</span>, particularly in relation to ideas of the home. As Bate explores </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd ya2 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">the links between human and land, Bachelard explores the links between human and dwelling, or </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd ya3 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">“the sorts of space that may be grasped, that may be defended against adverse forces, the space </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd ya4 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">we love.” (xxxv) He is doing a reading of these spaces we love through dreams and obsessive </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd ya5 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">returnings, to houses that we have left and now only remember. He is both the critic of the actual </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd ya6 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">structure of the home, and of the haunting of it. Maurice Blanchot lends a similarly experiential </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd ya7 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">reading of language to the project, as I borrow from “Literature and the Right to Death” to trace </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y4a ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">the possibilities and dangers that words hold in the project of inhabitation. </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y9 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0"> <span class="_ _5"> </span>Gillian Beer and Peter Brooks form the basis of my narratological study of both Cather </div><div class="t m0 x4 he y9f ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">and Hardy.

In labor, both </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y89 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">Cather and Hardy find the synthesis of motion and stillness. Labor, as Hannah Arendt defines it, </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y8a ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">is the physical activity relating solely to the biological continuance of the body – food and </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y8b ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">shelter; it “leaves nothing behind”, and instead exists purely in its enactment. Labor engages both </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y70 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">diachronic and synchronic logic, related as it is to the seasons and to a world that is marked by </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y41 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">all time that is passed, and to the repetitive, associative, patterns of the body in a tethered </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y8c ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">relationship to a particular part of the earth.  Labor, in its direct, physical engagement with the </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y98 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">material world, binds you to the earth, forms a merged space between person and place, and links </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y99 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">you more and more firmly to the seasons, to the ephemerons, and to the language of “inarticulate </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y9a ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">things.”  It encompasses both metonymic linking, and metaphoric merging. And it is too, the </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y9b ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">activity that Cather and Hardy have most intensely left behind themselves – they may walk back </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y9c ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">over the moors, or return to their prairie town house, but they have cut themselves off from the </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y62 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">world of labor and instead moved into work as something very different. As Arendt defines </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y9d ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">work, it is the opposite of labor, a process that leaves something “durable” in its aftermath. Work </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y9e ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">is the “work of our hands” rather than the “labor of our bodies”, writes Arendt, where laboring </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y9 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">“mixes with” working “works upon”. (136) The durable things created by work – a table, a </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y9f ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">house, a book – give “the human artifice the stability and solidity without which it could not be </div></div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>

Yet, as Arendt, and Blanchot, and even Hardy and Cather argue, this fabrication is </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y1a ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">necessarily violent – it destroys as much as it makes, and the safe space of the written world is </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y1c ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">not as safe as it may appear.

Arendt warns of the “dead letter” and in tying ourselves to the world of the </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y21 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">word we are tying ourselves potentially to this empty set of signs. So instead, Cather and Hardy </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y22 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">have to envision a combination of the two – a writing that becomes a process of living, of re-</div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y23 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">entering the land they have left. Through writing there is the hope of merging with the material </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y24 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">that is written, or enacting Hardy’s merger of laborer and material.

Being unable to navigate, not knowing a place well enough to get you where you </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y1a ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">want to be, is similar to not knowing a language, or how to read certain signs.  </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y1c ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0"> <span class="_ _5"> </span>Touch-sight is needed literally to find a way to cross the heath; on the prairie, however, </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y1e ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">the narrowing of vision, the movement towards touch, is important less in terms of getting lost, </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y20 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">and more in terms of defining edges and boundaries.

It must have </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y25 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">been the scarcity of detail in that tawny landscape that made detail so precious.” (MA, 29) His </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd ya1 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">world is in need of definition, of edges.

To be in a world that big without obvious </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd ya4 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">signs of other living beings is lonely.

Paths attest to the walking of men on the heath. Here the heath is </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y23 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">marking Clym, claiming him as well as marking him “native” in every possible sense.   </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y24 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0"> <span class="_ _5"> </span>This attention to detail not only determines the pace of the plot, the world present, but it </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y25 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">also affords the characters with a link to the place they are walking in. Anne Wallace describes a </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd ya1 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">poet growing more and more intricate in his description of the countryside through which he </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd ya2 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">wanders.

Mikhail Bakhtin, in his essay </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y18 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">“Forms of Time and the Chronotope in the Novel: Notes toward a Historical Poetics”, creates the </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y1a ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">word “chronotope” – literally “time space” – to describe “the intrinsic connectedness of temporal </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y1c ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">and spatial relationships that are artistically expressed in literature.” He goes on to write that the </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y1e ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">literary chronotope blends time and space into one, so that “time, as it were, thickens, takes on </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y20 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">flesh, becomes artistically visible; likewise, space becomes charged and responsive to the </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y21 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">movements of time, plot and history.” (84) The time of plot is inevitably bound to the material </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y22 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">world of space.

So he includes many time-scales, from the geological </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y62 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">time of Egdon Heath to the world of ephemerons.” (240) Hardy, in Beer’s hands, is responding </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y9d ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">to Darwin not by simply taking on a plot of biological time – an image of the world that erases </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y9e ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">all individual and human markers in the face of the whole of time and evolution – but by tying it </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y9 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">to both the life of an individual – “the world of ephemerons” – and the voice of the narrator – </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y9f ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">something between the death and life of an insect and the death and life of a race.

(170) </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y9a ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">Alexandra, Bender argues, is Cather’s creation of a pattern of evolution based on Henri </div><div class="t m0 x4 he y9b ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">Bergson’s <span class="ff8">Creative Evolution</span> that rests in the push of whole generations forward, the idea that </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y9c ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">“the living being is above all a thoroughfare, and that the essence of life is in the movement by </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y62 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">which life is transmitted” (167).

In <span class="ff8">The Woodlanders</span>, Mrs. Charmond’s house is described as “a house in whose </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y1e ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">reverberations queer old personal tales were yet audible if properly listened for; and not, as with </div><div class="t m0 x4 he y20 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">those of the castle and cloister, silent beyond the possibility of an echo.” (<span class="ff8">Woodlanders</span>, 22) A </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y21 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">house holds old stories and old patterns. “Queer old personal tales,” and tales mixed with the </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y22 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">generations past and the present ones now hearing them, combine the impersonal and the </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y23 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">personal. In this sense, the house collects the traces of different strains of time, different forms of </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y24 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">living in a place, of being at home in the world. </div><div class="t m0 x13 hd y8c ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">We stay in place through the houses that we build and then inhabit. These structures that </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y98 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">we make allow stillness and placedness, a way of containing motion within four walls, and </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y99 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">letting motion add to motion add to our sleeping stillness, so that we no longer move away from </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y9a ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">home but instead move into it.

In Bakhtin’s essay on the chronotope, he describes </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y86 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">“folkloric time” based in the “pre-class, agricultural stage in the development of human society,” </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y87 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">an organization centered not on the life of the individual but on the life of a whole human and </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y88 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">natural world. (206) The idyllic chronotope comes out of this time, built upon the cycles both of </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y89 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">the natural world (spring summer autumn winter) and of the human (birth, age, death, holidays </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y8a ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">and working-times). The idyllic chronotope is “an organic fastening down, a grafting of life and </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y8b ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">its events to place”. (225) The idyllic chronotope stays in a single space, and according to </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y70 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">Bakhtin, it leads to a “blurring of all the temporal boundaries made possible by a unity of place” </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y41 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">and “also contributes in an essential way to the creation of the cyclic rhythmicalness of time so </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y8c ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">characteristic of the idyll.” (225) In some ways this is directly reflected in the time that has been </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y98 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">accreted in the corners and rooms of houses and streets in Casterbridge. Time, for Hardy, is not </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y99 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">arranged on a timeline but in the architectural space of a city, or the layers of the soil. It has an </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y9a ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">inherently physical form; as Bakhtin writes, “such time is fleshed-out, irreversible (within the </div><div class="t m0 x4 he y9b ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">limits of the cycle), realistic.<span class="ff8">”</span> (208) The vision of idyllic time that Bakhtin describes out is </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y9c ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">devoid of the ending that occurs in personal history, or personal time. This is the time that goes </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y62 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">on and on. As one person dies they are replaced by the next, as one city falls it is built on top of </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y9d ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">and becomes the foundation of the one after it. Yet this is not the form Hardy chooses for his </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y9e ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">novels. He insists stridently upon patterning his novels solely on the life of the individual, </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y9 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">necessarily cutting off the possibility of this glorious renewal. For as Bakhtin declares, as soon as </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y9f ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">the narrative, or the society the narrative is written from, changes from the general whole to the </div></div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>

He is re-introducing traumatic </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y22 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">ending, death into the novel, insisting as much on the death of the individual as on the individual </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y23 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">himself.  </div><div class="t m0 x13 he y41 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">In <span class="ff8">The Mayor of Casterbridge</span>, the historical time of the city itself is held in archeological </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y8c ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">layers. The city literally conceals “the dead men of Rome. It was impossible to dig more than a </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y98 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">foot or two deep about the town fields and gardens without coming upon some tall soldier or </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y99 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">other of the Empire, who had lain there in his silent unobtrusive rest for a space of fifteen </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y9a ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">hundred years.” (55) These bodies and all of their accessories (a bronze brooch, an urn, a jar, a </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y9b ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">bottle) are deemed a “familiar spectacle” by passers-by, both a novelty and a part of the structure </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y9c ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">and daily life of the town. Even as Hardy’s narrator points to the seeming distance, however, </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y62 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">between the lives of the present and the deaths of the past, he insists that they are right on top of </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y9d ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">each other, existing in both the same time and space.

(Millgate, 241) For all its newness this </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y97 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">house was literally rooted in the ancient ruins of Roman times. During its construction, which </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd ya0 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">was done by his father and brother and heavily overseen by himself, they dug up “Romano-</div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y18 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">British skeletons” while they were setting up the foundation. The house therefore included both </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y1a ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">the traces of an ancient history and an entirely new enterprise – neither thatched cottage, nor </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y1c ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">grand estate, but a strange new building with brick and mortar and many windows, a rough </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y1e ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">hillside, newly planted trees, the harshness of heath and the softness of a domesticated garden </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y20 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">and orchard, and the several, changing, studies of a man at work writing. (238-243) The house </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y21 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">became the sign, or space, of an in-betweeness, a form of settling into being in the world that </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y22 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">was both private and public, a space of daily use and of creation, far from his roots as the son of </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y23 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">a working-man and yet made out of that very past. <span class="_ _e"> </span> </div><div class="t m0 x13 hd y41 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">The house can become a materialization of our actions.

The wall of the shell comes from the body of the </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y1a ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">inhabitant, the mollusk wrapping itself in the hard protection of its own histories. It works as a </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y1c ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">traveling home, a deeply private solitude. This fits our dream house, wrapping us in traces of our </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y1e ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">former selves, forming a thick protective layer between self and world. The shell however is </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y20 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">unsharable and unrooted. It is a dream space but not a true space. A nest, on the other hand, is </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y21 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">made more like our actual physical houses are made, with a separate material shaped to a new </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y22 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">form. The nest, Bachelard and Jules Michelet, who he quotes, argue, is made from the inside out </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y23 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">by a pressure of the body against the walls, the bird is “‘constantly turning round and round and </div><div class="t m0 x4 he y24 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">pressing back the walls on every side”. (<span class="ff8">Poetics, </span>101) Unlike the shell, the nest is not an </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y25 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">excretion but the accumulated traces of former actions, a continuous contact between body and </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd ya1 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">material, hands and walls. Michelet writes,  </div><div class="t m0 x13 hd y99 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">‘The nest is the bird’s very person; it is its form and its most immediate effort, I shall </div><div class="t m0 x13 hd yad ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">even say its suffering. The result is only obtained by constantly repeated pressure of the </div><div class="t m0 x13 hd y9a ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">breast. There is not one of these blades of grass that, in order to make it curve and hold </div><div class="t m0 x13 hd yae ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">the curve, has not been pressed on countless times by the bird’s breast, its heart, surely </div><div class="t m0 x13 hd y9b ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">with difficulty in breathing, perhaps even with palpitations.’ (101) </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd ybd ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">As Bachelard points out, this is a deeply human point of view.

The body of the bird, in Michelet’s </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y63 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">romantic reading, is almost one with the interior of the nest.

Lifeholds are tenancies that last only as long as the </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y128 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">person who lives in the house – specifically the father or husband – is alive. In selling the rights </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y129 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">of the future of the house to the local estate, there is both the draw of money and the hope that </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y12a ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">the lifehold will simply be bought again. With the death of a man, however, his entire family is </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y12b ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">left homeless.

Labor </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y70 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">is how we grow things, how we eat, how we keep ourselves alive. According to Arendt, this is </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y41 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">why there is a distinction, and a hierarchy, between work and labor: to labor is “to be enslaved </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y8c ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">by necessity,” (83) tied to the unending need for food, for shelter, for reproduction, whereas to </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y98 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">work is to fabricate, to make the durable things that “give rise to the familiarity of the world,” </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y99 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">(94) the tables, benches, monuments that make up our solid and memorable places. “Men,” </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y9a ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">Arendt writes, “their ever-changing nature notwithstanding, can retrieve their sameness, that is, </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y9b ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">their identity, by being related to the same chair and the same table.” (137) Throughout history, </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y9c ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">Arendt argues, we have searched for ways to distance ourselves from the act of labor, to create a </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y62 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">“world between men and nature”, so that we are not made and unmade in the “eternal </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y9d ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">movement” of nature.

Labor ties the laborer to the </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y109 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">necessities of life, to “the darkness and pain of necessity.” (119) Yet it also ties the human </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y10a ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">laborer, unerringly, to life. Labor is a rooting, a deep engagement with the material of the action. </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y8d ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">In the closeness of labor and consumption comes both the pain and pleasure Arendt elaborates </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y8e ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">on, and too, a linking of the laborer and the earth.

No mere transference across space, labor in Hardy incorporates land into self and self into </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y24 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">land, so that, at least for the moment of bundling the corn, or the time spent afield, the two are </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y25 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">somehow one.  </div><div class="t m0 x13 hd y98 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">For Cather the interaction between farmer and farmed land is less rooted in the intensity </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y99 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">of actual labor and more in a relationship between land and person accumulated over time. </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y9a ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">Merging of the human and the non-human comes most clearly in the realm of farming.

The </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y88 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">most terrifying example of this mechanical death comes obliquely: after Hardy gave up novels </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y89 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">and Cather took a break from Red Cloud, World War One began in 1914 and tore the world </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y8a ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">apart.

He moves from the  “rail-track and the highway”, the space of the </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y9a ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">powerful war starters, back towards the “loamy Wessex lanes” home to those sent to die on the </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y9b ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">front.

J. Hillis Miller, in a similar statement, declares, “to be conscious is to be </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd yfe ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">separated.” (3) Work only pulls us further away from the physical world, from the feeling of </div><div class="t m0 x4 hd y73 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">being part and of.
