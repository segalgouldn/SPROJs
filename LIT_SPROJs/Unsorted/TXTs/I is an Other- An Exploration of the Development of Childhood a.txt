Acknowledgments
I would like to sincerely thank all of invaluable people who have helped me reach
this point, both academically and personally.
Dierdre D’Albertis and Sarah Dunphy-Lelii – I could not have asked for more
intelligent, supportive and inspirational women to guide me the past four years at Bard.
Dierdre; I am extremely lucky to have been a part of your life, as well as your
family’s. From the first day of L&T, you have helped carve a home for me at Bard, both
in and out of the classroom.
If it were not for you, Sarah, and your invigorating Introduction to Psychology
course in September 2008, there is quite a chance that I would not have moderated into
the Psychology department; I am very glad that I did, and I thank you entirely for that.
I would like to thank Barbara Luka, for her perpetual patience and
encouragement, specifically throughout the project-brainstorming process.
Lastly, I would like to thank my dear friends. Thank you for listening to me and
loving me.

For my family: mom, dad, and little j
I could not have done this without you.
I love you.

What is necessary, after all, is only this: solitude, vast inner solitude. To walk
inside yourself and meet no one for hours – that is what you must be able to attain. To be
solitary as you were when you were a child, when the grownups walked around involved
with matters that seemed large and important because they looked so busy and because
you didn’t understand a thing about what they were doing.
And when you realize that their activities are shabby, that their vocations are
petrified and no longer connected with life, why not then continue to look upon it all as a
child would, as if you were looking at something unfamiliar, out of the depths of your
own world, from the vastness of your solitude, which is itself work and status and
vocation? Why should you want to give up a child’s not-understanding in exchange for
defensiveness and scorn, since not-understanding is, after all, a way of being alone,
whereas defensiveness and scorn are a participation in precisely what, by these means,
you want to separate yourself from.
Think, dear Sir, of the world that you carry inside you, and call this thinking
whenever you want to: a remembering of your own childhood or a yearning toward a
future of your own – only be attentive to what is arising within you, and place that above
everything you perceive around you. What is happening in your innermost self is worthy
of your entire love; somehow you must find a way to work at it, and not lose too much
time or too much courage in clarifying your attitude towards people.
… and children are still the way you were as a child, sad and happy in just the
same way – and if you think of your childhood, you once again live among them, among
the solitary children, and the grownups are nothing, and their dignity has no value.
-- Rainer Maria Rilke, Letters to a Young Poet

Introduction
Je est un autre. So wrote the 17-year-old French poet Arthur Rimbaud on May 13,
1871 in a letter addressed to his professor, Georges Izambard, The famous quotation has
been translated in various ways -- “I is another”, “I is someone else”, “I is an Other” –
and while the elusiveness and untranslatability of Rimbaud’s dictum is perhaps part of its
appeal, all iterations attempt to embody the same idea: the nebulous yet integral
relationship between ‘the Self’ and ‘the Other’. Perhaps the adage must be somewhat
indeterminate in order to describe the simultaneous universality and specificity that
comprises the experience of the Self in society – as social beings, we all inevitably
encounter the influence of the Other, yet how that impact manifests itself varies from
person to person.
As the intentional vagueness of Rimbaud’s syntax points out, not only do the Self
and the Other simultaneous shape one another, but they are not mutually exclusive; one is
always both ‘the Self’ and ‘the Other’, and one cannot define oneself without taking into
account the Other. For example, if at a party I walk into a crowd of strangers who are all
acquainted with one another, to them, I am suddenly the Other. They do not know me, I
am not like them; I do not know them, they are not like me, and thus to me, they are the
Other. I cannot help but compare myself to them as they cannot help but judge me,
evaluate me as ‘with them’ or ‘against them’. I must decide if I would like to join them;
do they bore me? Amuse me? Offend me? By examining and assessing them, the Other, I
am calling into question my own character too: the Self. Do I enjoy spending time with
people who are like the strangers before me? Do their cold eyes and whispers deter me

2
from introducing myself? Does their raucous laugher excite me? Annoy me? What do my
thoughts and what does my next move say about me, about who I am?
Though in most social settings one may not be consciously aware of the shifting
dynamic between Self and Other in such step-by-step detail, the reality of existing as a
social being in a social world is that the Self and the Other are never separate. Though the
exchange in my example took place instantaneously, wordlessly, the confrontation of Self
and Other intensifies when language is involved, as linguistic expression is our primary
means of communication once we are more than a few months old. One of the first
questions we are asked when we are young is, “what is your name?” and even as we age
most conversations begin with a comparable inquiry. Similarly, if we think we hear an
address in a crowded room we ask, “Are you talking to me?” As Judith Butler writes in
the introduction to her book Excitable Speech: A Politics of the Performative, “to be
addressed is not merely to be recognized for what one already is, but to have the very
term conferred by which the recognition of existence becomes possible. One comes to
‘exist’ by virtue of this fundamental dependency on the address of the Other” (Butler,
1997). In other words, Butler approaches the anthropomorphized version of the
philosophical thought experiment, ‘if a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear
it, does it make a sound?’; If a person is born but no one is around to acknowledge him,
what kind of life does he lead? On what does he base his identity?
“Language sustains the body not by bringing it into being or feeding it in a literal
way,” Butler continues. “Rather, it is by being interpellated within the terms of language
that a certain social existence of the body first becomes possible. To understand this, one
must imagine an impossible scene, that of a body that has not yet been given social

3
definition, a body that is, strictly speaking, not accessible to us, that nevertheless
becomes accessible on the occasion of an address, a call, an interpellation that does not
‘discover’ this body, but constitutes it fundamentally.” We are social beings who rely on
others to help shape us, and we are linguistic beings who rely on language to convey our
thoughts, feelings, and ideas. Therefore it logically follows that we rely on the language
of others to recognize us and give us a place, either literally -- "here’s a seat!” -- or
metaphorically -- "what is your name?”
Butler coins this dependence on the confluence of language and the Other as
'linguistic vulnerability’. Language can welcome as well as exclude: “could language
injure us if we were not, in some sense, linguistic beings, beings who require language in
order to be? Is our vulnerability to language a consequence of our being constituted
within its terms?” (Butler, 1997) It is precisely the latter part of this question that interests
me and has incited the following project: are we so affected by language -- the words we
choose to speak, the words that are spoken to us, the words that we hear around us -- that
we form ourselves within it, through it, around it, as opposed to apart from it? Rather
than growing up, forming our identities, and choosing to speak the words that fit our
sense of selves best, I argue that we cannot separate our development from words, and
that we are, in fact, “formed in language” (Butler, 1997).
This ‘hypothesis’ can be explicated in a variety of ways, and explorers in the past
have employed philosophy, anthropology, and psychology, among other approaches, in
an attempt to identify the power of language and its effect on our consciousness. Two
years ago, The New York Times published an article entitled, “Does Your Language
Shape How you Think?” which concluded that “when we learn our mother tongue, we do

4
after all acquire certain habits of thought that shape our experience in significant and
often surprising ways” (Deutscher, 2010). In 1956, anthropologist Benjamin Lee Whorf
asserted that “language is the factor that limits free plasticity and rigidifies channels of
development in [an] autocratic way” (Whorf, 1956) -- namely, if a language does not
have a word for a certain concept, idea, tense, then the native speakers of that language
are unable to conceive of said concept. Though his extremist view soon proved to be false
(despite the following his alluring notion of the absolute power of language garnered),
The Times drew on a range of sources that show that language does in fact help structure
our minds, and by extension, our perceived realities. As linguist Roman Jakobson said,
“‘Languages differ essentially in what they must convey and not in what they may
convey.’” Deutscher continues, “if different languages influence our minds in different
ways, this is not because of what our language allows us to think but rather because of
what it habitually obliges us to think about”. To use the article’s example, in English I
can tell you that I saw a friend last night, yet in a gendered language such as Spanish or
French, I would have to also tell you if my friend was male (mi amigo) or female (mi
amiga).
Both German and Spanish are gendered languages, yet many words that are
feminine in German are masculine in Spanish, and vice versa. In a study done by Toshi
Konishi (1993), German speakers and Spanish speakers were asked to grade objects on
various characteristics, and not surprisingly, whether an object was ‘masculine’ or
‘feminine’ mediated what type of associations the participant had with that object. For
example, “a German bridge is feminine (die Brücke)…but el puente is masculine in
Spanish… Spanish speakers deemed bridges…to have more ‘manly properties’ like

5
strength, but Germans tended to think of them as more slender or elegant” (Deutscher,
2010). Similarly, Deutscher describes the language of Guugi Yimithirr, an aboriginal
tongue spoken in Australia. Nearly every other language uses ‘egocentric coordinates’,
directional cues that are defined in relation to the body, such as ‘in front’, ‘behind’, ‘to
the left’, etc. However, the speakers of Guugi Yimithirr use solely cardinal directions,
such as ‘north’, ‘south’, ‘northeast’, etc. “In order to speak a language like Guugi
Yimithirr, you need to know where the cardinal directions are at each and every moment
of your waking life …This habit of constant awareness to the geographic direction is
inculcated almost from infancy: studies have shown that children in such societies start
using geographic directions as early as age 2 and fully master the system by 7 or 8. With
such an early and intense drilling, the habit soon becomes second nature, effortless and
unconscious” (Deutscher, 2010).
If such a skill as sustained awareness of north, south, east, and west can be
‘taught’ or passed down through language, what other influences on our consciousness
are implicit in the words we use? How do the words we hear and subsequently choose to
use affect the way we see our world? And more specifically, how do they influence the
way we see ourselves? How do we, as social, linguistic beings form our identity in
relation to our particular linguistic culture, and does that position -- and thus our concept
of our identity -- change throughout our lifetime? In the following project, I aspire to
explore these questions, focusing on the development of childhood and adolescent selfconcept, as mediated through language and the Other. By specifically investigating the
space of childhood, I hope to begin my multidisciplinary study at its ‘source’; namely at
the one of the earliest moments when individuals are old enough to start to think

6
reflexively and engage metacognition, as well as when they are verbal enough to begin to
express that self-concept. “There is a thing that happens with children,” writes M.R.
Montgomery in his memoir, “if no one is watching them, nothing is really happening to
them. It is not some philosophical conundrum like the one about the tree falling in the
forest and no one hearing it: that is a puzzler for college freshman. No. If you are very
small, you actually understand that there is no point in jumping into the swimming pool
unless they see you do it. The child crying, ‘Watch me, watch me,’ is not begging for
attention; he is pleading for existence itself” (Montgomery, 1989).
In “I is an Other”: An Exploration of the Development of Childhood and
Adolescent Self-Concept, I employ two different approaches in investigation -- empirical
psychological research and creative literary representation. The project is divided into
two main chapters, which work together to highlight the strengths of each mode of
understanding; in endeavoring to write a multidisciplinary project, I intend to render as
extensive and exhaustive a view of this topic as possible. Chapter 1 approaches childhood
and adolescent self-concept from a psychological background, and Chapter 2 from a
literary one; each chapter is broken down into multiple subheadings that further organize
and clarify the ideas set forth in each.
Chapter 1 contains an original empirical study, in which I asked children in 2nd,
5th, 8th, and 11th grade from Rhinebeck, NY to respond to a written prompt that read,
“What do you think is your best personality quality? What is a quality that you’d like to
change? Explain your responses. Give two examples from your life – one for each answer
– in which you demonstrated each quality.” The handwritten responses were then
collected, typed, and analyzed with two measures: Pennebaker et al.’s Linguistic Inquiry

7
and Word Count (2007) computer program, as well as a conceptually derived coding
system. The specifics for the experiment (Abstract, Method, Participants, Materials for
Data Collection, Measures for Data Analysis, Procedure) are included in the chapter, as
are Results, Discussion, Limitations, and Future Directions. Both the Results and
Discussion sections are organized by differences due to age as well as differences due to
gender. Lastly, in the Future Directions segment I suggest applications for my research,
positing the potential therapeutic and educational benefits for self-reflective writing.
The 2nd chapter approaches the development of childhood and adolescent selfconcept through an analysis of two modernist novels, The Waves by Virginia Woolf, and
A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man by James Joyce. In this section I strive to not
only further investigate the aspects of identity formation touched upon in the previous
chapter, but also to explore new ideas on child development put forth by Woolf and
Joyce. I explain the value of Modernist literature and its contribution to my particular
area of interest, specifically in the Modernists’ focus on cognition and subjectivity, and
go on to craft my argument about the trajectory of childhood identity formation. In
addition, I endeavor to strengthen the literary authors’ representations of childhood with
current psychological research, integrating the two approaches in Chapter 2 as I do with
the project as a whole.
By incorporating empirical research and artistic representation, I hope to engage
multiple modes of transmitting knowledge, addressing both concrete, ‘factual’ knowledge
through empirical psychology studies and ‘emotional’, abstract knowledge through an
explication of literary novels. The linchpin, however, is language, and how what we say,
and what others say to us, affects the way we view the world around us, and the way we

8
view ourselves. Do we choose the words we use to express aspects of ourselves that are
inherent in our being, or do the words we use shape that which we believe to be intrinsic?
“We might be tempted to think that attributing agency to language is not quite right, that
only subjects do things with language, and that agency has its origins in the subject” says
Butler. “But is the agency of language the same as the agency of the subject? Is there a
way to distinguish between the two? [Author Toni] Morrison not only offers agency as a
figure for language, but language as a figure for agency, one whose ‘reality’ is
incontestable. She writes: ‘we die. That may be the meaning of life. But we do language.
That may be the measure of our lives.’” (Butler, 1997)

Chapter 1: Empirical Research
Abstract
In this study I aim to obtain information about self-concept in children and
adolescents, tracking the development of and approach to identity formation as mediated
through linguistic and social developmental. By delivering the same timed written prompt
to students in 2nd, 5th, 8th, and 11th grade, I investigate linguistic differences across age
and gender, specifically language indicative of social awareness and emotional selfregulation. The prompt reads, “What do you think is your best personality quality? What
is a quality that you’d like to change? Explain your responses. Give two examples from
your life – one for each answer – in which you demonstrated each quality.” The research
also explores language as a route to understanding emotions, social relationships,
perspective taking skills, and awareness of the other.
The current study is mainly an exploration, meaning that while there are
hypotheses about the outcome, the intent of what follows is not to necessarily to ‘prove’
or ‘disprove’, but rather to learn about childhood and adolescent self-representation.
However, the overarching hypothesis is that there will be traceable changes in
participants’ language use as they age; more specifically, there will be differences
between the girls’ responses and the boys’ responses regardless of age, consistent with
earlier findings (i.e. Newman, Groom, Handelman & Pennebaker, 2008). I also
hypothesize certain similarities for each age group regardless of gender (i.e. Pennebaker
& Stone, 2003).

Method
Participants
152 participants (76 female, 76 male) from grades 2, 5, 8 and 11, aged 84 months
(7 years 0 months) – 217 months (18 years 1 month) (M = 166.59 months) participated in
the study. 12 participants (7 female, 5 male) were in 2nd grade, 17 participants (7 female,
10 male) were in 5th grade, 72 participants (36 female, 36 male) were in 8th grade, and 51
participants (26 female, 25 male) were in 11th grade. (Appendix A, Figure 1) All
participants were students in the public school system in Rhinebeck, NY, selected by
classroom by the principals of their school; 2nd and 5th graders attended Chancellor
Livingston Elementary School, 8th graders attended Bulkeley Middle School, and 11th
graders attended Rhinebeck High School. (See Appendices B and C for examples of
letters sent to the principals and teachers of the schools). All students were given
permission to participate by a parent/guardian through a traditional active consent system
(Appendix D) and were not compensated for their participation nor penalized for a lack
of participation. Parents/guardians were alerted of the study in advance by a brief
explanatory letter sent home with their child, as well as an email from the principal.
Parents/guardians subsequently returned the permission slip in order to allow or excuse
their child from participating. All responses were anonymous and each child identified
only by month and year of birth, gender, and grade, information that the participant wrote
him or herself.

Materials for Data Collection
The materials for the study included the typed up writing prompt (Appendix E),
blank lined paper which was handed out to participants, a writing utensil which the

11
participant provided him or herself, staplers to secure responses to the written prompt,
and a clock or watch to keep track of response time.

Measures for Data Analysis
Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count: Previous Research
Function Words and Content Words
The average person has about 50,000 English words in his or her vocabulary
(Gall, 2009). Function words -- such as pronouns, prepositions, articles, conjunctions,
and auxiliary verbs -- make up roughly 55% of all the words we speak (Tausczik &
Pennebaker, 2010), despite the fact that there are only about 500 of them in the English
language. Research has shown that these function words -- also called style words -reflect how people are communicating, whereas content words -- nouns, verbs, and many
adjectives and adverbs -- convey what they are saying. An analysis of function words can
detect status, honesty, and emotional and biological states, and are thought overall to be
more closely linked to measures of individuals’ social and psychological environments
than content words. “Indeed, the ability to use style words requires basic social skills,”
writes Tausczikl & Pennebaker (2010). “Consider the sentence, ‘I will meet you here
later.’ Although grammatically correct, the sentence has no real meaning unless the
reader knows who ‘I’ and ‘you’ refer to. Where is ‘here’ and what is meant by ‘later’?
These are all referents that are shared by two people in a particular conversation taking
place at a particular time. To say this implies that the speaker knows that the listener
shares the same knowledge of these style words”.

12
Pronouns
Rude, Gortner and Pennebaker (2004) discovered that people who are
experiencing physical or emotional pain tend to have their attention focused on
themselves, and therefore they tend to use more first-person singular pronouns. Stirman
& Pennebaker (2001) compared the published words of suicidal poets with matched nonsuicidal poets, and found that the suicidal poets used more first-person singular pronouns
and more death-related words. Similarly, when people sit in front of a mirror and
complete a questionnaire, they use more words such as “I” and “me” -- first-person
singular pronouns -- than those who complete the same questionnaire when a mirror is
not present (Davis & Brock, 1975). In studies in which status was a factor, such as the
pre-established hierarchy of an army or a flight crew, more frequent use of first-person
plural (“we”) was a good indicator of higher status, with those in charge feeling they had
the right to speak for everyone, whereas more frequent use of first-person singular
pronouns was a good predictor of lower status (Kacewicz, Pennebaker, David, Jeon &
Graesser, 2009).
Age, Gender, and Personality Type
Contrary to popular geriatric stereotypes, Pennebaker and Stone (2003) found that
as adults move from middle to old age, they become less self-focused, refer more to the
moment, and do not decline in verbal complexity. The researchers examined the writing
of participants of varying ages, as well as the text of published authors from the span of
their writing career. They found that first-person singular pronouns decreased with time
(hence the conclusion that older people are less self-focused), whereas insight words,
future tense verbs, and exclusive words increased, in both sets of observed populations.

13
Pennebaker, Mayne & Francis (1997) showed that the use of causal words (such as
“because”, “effect”, “hence”) and insight words (“think”, “know”, “consider”) in
describing a past event can suggest the active process of reappraisal, which was
correlated with great health improvements. In a study by Boals and Klein (2005),
participants who described a painful relationship breakup used more cognitive
mechanisms -- specifically causal words -- in talking about the breakup and post-breakup,
compared with the breakup itself.
Gender stereotypes however, may hold true in the research -- both in everyday life
and in many studies (i.e. Dennison, 1999, Tannen, 1990), women and men tend to not
only use ‘different’ language, but also to recognize gender-specific language when
listening to recordings of speakers with unspecified genders. Using the Linguistic
Inquiry and Word Count program, Newman, Groom, Handelman & Pennebaker (2008)
added to this research, and found that women use more social words and references to
others, while men use more complex language: Newman et al. operationalized complex
language as large words, articles, and prepositions, while references to others were
defined by social words and pronouns. However, Mehl, Gosling & Pennebaker (2006)
found that both male and female extraverts had a higher word count and fewer large
words than male and female introverts. Pennebaker and King (1999) also concluded that
the writing of extraverts less frequently used complex language than the writing of
introverts, while extraverts more frequently used social words and positive emotion
words. In their study, complex language was operationalized as use of articles, exclusive
words, causal words, and negations.

Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count: How it Works
Once the raw written data was collected, it was entered into James W.
Pennebaker, Roger J. Booth, and Martha E. Francis’ language processing computer
program, the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC). When LIWC was first
developed, “the goal was to devise an efficient system that could tap both psychological
processes and the content of what people were talking or writing about” (Tausczikl &
Pennebaker, 2010). The software, published in 2007, analyzes inputted text on a wordby-word basis and calculates the percentage of words in the text that fall in to each of the
language categories; the program automatically recognizes up to 82 different language
dimensions (such as total pronouns, cognitive processes, achievement, and relativity), but
also allows for new categories to be created by the user. See Appendix F for the complete
list of categories, along with example words.
In order to better understand the process by which LIWC analyzes text, I present
the following example, as taken from Tausczikl and Pennebaker (2010). Their example
uses the opening line of the novel Paul Clifford (1842) by Edward Bulwer-Lytton: “It
was a dark and stormy night”
The program would first look at the word “it” and then see if “it” was in the
dictionary. It is and is coded as a function word, a pronoun, and, more specifically,
an impersonal pronoun. All three of these LIWC categories would then be
incremented. Next, the word “was” would be checked and would be found to be
associated with the categories of verbs, auxiliary verbs, and past tense verbs.
After going through all the words in the novel, LIWC would calculate the percentage of each LIWC category. So, for example, we might discover that 2.34% of all
the words in a given book were impersonal pronouns and 3.33% were auxiliary
verbs. The LIWC output, then, lists all LIWC categories and the rates that each
category was used in the given text.
Unlike other data analysis processes, initial LIWC output is in the form of
percentages (as in what percent of the entire analyzed text falls under that particular

15
category) and can be read and easily understood before any specific formulaic
computations, though the numbers can be used in more complex analyses after the initial
output returns. For the purposes of the current study, the output was analyzed with t-tests
and correlations. The program analyzes text and outputs percentages for each category:
see Appendix G for an example of output from an analysis of the first two pages of
Virginia Woolf’s novel The Waves.

Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count: How it was created
In creating LIWC Pennebaker et al. built on previous research, such as
McClelland’s 1976 Thematic Apperception Tests (TAT). This assessment found that the
stories people told in response to drawings of other people could provide important clues
to their needs for affiliation, power and achievement. In 1978, Phillip Stone adapted
McClelland’s experiment and created the General Inquirer, a very basic computer
program that relied on author-developed algorithms and could distinguish mental
disorders and personality dimensions from entered text. In 1981 Walter Weintraub began
hand counting people’s words in texts -- such as political speeches and medical
interviews -- and noticed that first-person singular pronouns (such as “I”, “me”, “my”)
were reliably linked to people’s levels of depression (Weintraub, 1981, 1989). A few
years later, Pennebaker and Beall (1986) began collecting writing samples in which
participants were asked to write about emotional upheavals in their lives; judges were
asked to read the essays and evaluate them along previously established dimensions.
Pennebaker and Beall found that even after rigorous training, the judges did not agree on
various ratings, perhaps because of the emotional and personal nature of the writing
samples. In addition, having judges rate written data was slow and expensive. Thus arose

16
the impetus for the creation of LIWC, “a more efficient evaluation method” (Tausczikl &
Pennebaker, 2010)
In the 1990s, Pennebaker and his colleagues began creating a massive dictionary
from which their new program could analyze inputted text. They collected text files from
several dozen studies, totaling more than 100 million English words. After compiling
such a massive corpus, the team appointed a group of judges to rate the potential
dictionary words. The initial judging took place between 1992 -1994, and word lists were
created from those judged words: a word remained in a category (such as “emotion” or
“first-person plural pronoun”) if 2 of 3 judges agreed it should be included; a word was
removed by the same 2/3 majority, and it was added to an entirely new category if 2/3
believed it should be, though categories are not mutually exclusive. This entire processes
was then repeated a final time by a separate group of three judges, and the dictionary was
revised in 1997, and again in 2007. When the dictionary was complete, the final
percentages of judges’ agreement ranged from 93%-100% agreement. The dictionary is
composed of almost 4,500 words and word stems: an example of a word stem is “hungr”,
which will code in the LIWC dictionary as “hungry”, “hungrier”, or “hungriest, etc. Each
word or word stem fits in to one or more word categories: for example “cried”, which is
part of the sadness category, negative emotion, overall affect, verb, and past tense verb.

Conceptually Derived Coding System
Limitations of LIWC and the Necessity for a Supplementary Measure
In order to ensure the most comprehensive picture of the data, I analyzed the
participants’ responses with two measures: Pennebaker et al.’s (2007) Linguistic Inquiry
and Word Count (LIWC) computer program, as well as a conceptually derived coding

17
system which categorized the participants’ responses. Despite the sophisticated, rapid,
and inexpensive analyses allowed by LIWC, it is nonetheless still a computerized
measure, and therefore has limitations that would ostensibly not be issues for human
coders. For example, because LIWC computes text on a word-by-word basis, word order
is not taken into account: in both the phrases “I am not happy” as well as “I am happy”,
“happy” is recognized as an affective process, as well as a positive emotion word. Irony,
sarcasm, and idioms are also ignored, and in the phrase “he’s mad as a hatter” or “after
our fight I sarcastically told him I wasn’t mad”, “mad” would still be coded as an anger
word. I therefore created a supplementary coding system, in order to capture results that
the word-by-word analysis of LIWC would not have sufficiently recognized, as well as to
investigate qualitatively different results that the program was not designed to analyze.
Though I had certain hypothesis about the outcome of the study, the main goal
was to conduct an investigation of a certain set of data, and thus any existing computer
program would be too strict and limit the results. In other words, I am interested in the
way words work together in a certain context to form meaning. Once the data was
collected, various patterns emerged, and from these initial patterns some revealed
themselves to be significant trends, whereas others were simply flukes in the first few
responses that were read and therefore discounted. However, due to the open ended
nature of the writing prompt and subsequently the open ended nature of the responses, a
complimentarily open ended coding system was in demand.
Categorization of Positive and Negative Quality
Though the intent was always to categorize the data, the specific aggregates were
determined after data collection. After written responses were collected, the data was read

18
over, and lists were made of each student’s responses. From these lists general patterns
emerged, and the disparate qualities formed more cohesive aggregates. In other words,
the categories listed below arose from a familiarity with the data; while individual
students’ responses varied in word choice – an expected result whose significance is
reflected in the LIWC output – their responses fell rather cleanly in to distinct categories.
Participants’ best personality quality was placed into one of the following 7
aggregates1: Optimism, Helping Others, Expectation, Social, Humor, Tangible, and
Miscellaneous Good. (See Appendix H for a complete list of the categories, as well as the
qualities that comprised each) To elaborate on each of the categories: as expected,
participants were placed in the Optimism category if they either explicitly listed their best
quality as such, or expressed a synonymously hopeful, confident or positive quality, such
as “open minded”, “positive attitude” or “happy most of the time”. Similarly, participants
categorized under Helping Others displayed an altruistic quality that benefitted friends,
family, peers, or strangers, such as “compassion”, “thoughtful”, or “kind”. The
Expectation category refers to participants whose best quality was one which society
deems as desirable or expected – i.e. “polite”, “trustworthy”, or “strong work ethic”.
Participants in this category reported more general and moral qualities, less nuanced than
some of the other groups; in other words, I felt that participants in this group more often
than not gave a socially ‘appropriate’ response, one that tended to be vague and often not
1

It should be noted that though the categories are mutually exclusive – i.e. each
participant was only given one label, there were occasionally overlaps, meaning a
participant could fit into one or more categories. If this was the case, the example
provided by the participant was referred to, and the extra detail given by the context of
the listed quality allowed it to be placed into one category or another. Similarly, a few
participants listed more than one positive and negative quality; when this happened, only
the first quality listed was looked at, though again the example was relied on for extra
detail.

19
match up with their example. On many occasions the children who were placed under
this category listed one quality as their best quality (i.e. “how much of a gentleman I
am”) when their example was in many ways showing that they were something else (i.e.
“I am always nice to people … I hold the door open for anyone behind me and I help
people up when they are down. Also, I have helped many elderly ladies/men across the
street”). The Social category consisted of, not surprisingly, qualities that are central to
successful social interactions, such as “friendly”, “loyal”, and “outgoing”2. The Humor
category is perhaps the most obvious of all the means of organization, as participants
listed qualities directly related to humor, i.e. “funny”, “good sense of humor”, or “make
people laugh”3. The Tangible category is ostensibly the most oddly named category, but
it refers to participants who responded to the prompt with a concrete, often skill-based
quality. For example, “athletic ability”, “height”, and “dancing” were all listed by
students; had the prompt been, “what is your favorite thing about yourself” or “what is
your best skill”, then these responses would be entirely appropriate. However, because
the prompt specifically called for personality qualities (which were explained to each
group of participants. See Appendix I for the study scripts) these responses were atypical,
and students incorrectly cited a concrete, physical, or tangible thing – typically something
the participant did rather than thought or felt – as opposed to a more sophisticated and
2

While these qualities could potentially be categorized under Helping Others (an
arguably pro-social category), I was interested in the intensely social focus of these
participants’ responses, and therefore created a Social category in addition to Helping
Others. Similarly, many participants under the Social category prided themselves on said
qualities because it brought them popularity, a different motivator than the majority of
those under Helping Others.
3
“funny”, “good sense of humor” or “make people laugh” are not intended to be parallel,
as many of the qualities in the other categories are; because of the definite distinctions
between each quality, another measure – the self-based quality versus the other-based
quality – was implemented.

20
abstract quality. Lastly, a Miscellaneous category had to be created for the remaining 8
participants who did not fit into any of the other groups: in this category, one participant
cited “active”, one cited “quiet” and one cited “observant”, two cited “confident” and
three cited “creative”.
Similarly, the qualities that they would like to change – referred to henceforth as
‘negative’ qualities - fell under 1 of 7 categories; Tangible, Low Self-Esteem,
Expectation Violation, Impulse Control, Anxiety, Overly Emotional, and None. Similar
to the positive quality category, negative qualities that fell under the Tangible category
were also physical and concrete rather, than more abstract and behavioral -- for example,
“better at jokes”, “my weight” and “not being able to get up in the morning”.4 The Low
Self-Esteem category was for participants who self-identified as such, - i.e. “jealous”,
“self-conscious”, “shy” -- rather than those whose low self-esteem was evident through
other aspects of their writing5. Expectation Violation corresponds to the Expectation
category in positive qualities, encompassing negative qualities that are classically
disapproved of. For example, “bossy”, “stubborn”, or “laziness”; if the expectation is that
individuals should be agreeable and hard working, participants in this category recognize
that they have violated the societal expectation. Impulse Control is more self-explanatory,

4

Because the study is not only interested in what the participants cited as their
best and worst qualities but also how they said it, it is important to note that students did
phrase the quality that they would like to change in more tangible terms. While the
student who wants to change their weight could be categorized under Low Self-Esteem,
they remained under Tangible due to their linguistic choices.
5
In other words, participants who wrote about how much they hated their physical
appearance in the example section of the prompt, but cited the quality that they wanted to
change as something Impulse Control-related or as falling under another category.
Though their self-confidence issues became clear through the ways in which they talked
about themselves, they did not identify their self-esteem issues as their least favorite
quality.

21
comprised of qualities such as “impatient”, “too competitive”, or “short tempered”. In
other words, when participants cited an inability to govern their own actions or emotions,
they were labeled as Impulse Control. Participants in the Anxiety category cited “worry
too much”, “perfectionist”, “paranoid” etc. as the quality they would like to change6.
Similarly, the Overly Emotional category was filled with “too sensitive”, “trust issues”,
“dramatic”, etc. While these qualities are very similar to Impulse Control -- as in the
participants wished they could control their emotions and thus maintain a more socially
acceptable level of sensitivity --the strictly emotional focus as opposed to
competitiveness or procrastination warranted its own category. Lastly, the category None
was for the few students who specifically wrote, “I don’t want to change”; when
participants neglected to list a negative quality (due to misunderstanding of the prompt,
lack of time, lack of focus, or another miscellaneous reason), “n/a” was listed in the
coding sheet.
Ratio of Positive to Negative Qualities
In this simple measure, the number of positive qualities as well as the number of
negative qualities listed by each participant was recorded. The ratio (positive : negative )
was calculated, and ratios for age and gender were computed.
Acknowledgement of the Reader
This measure recorded the number of times the participant addressed or
acknowledged the reader, demonstrating awareness of the audience or of the other. This

6

Again, it should be stressed that these categories are mainly reliant on what the
participant cites him or herself as opposed to my assessment; for example, there was one
student who seemed quite evidently to suffer from anxiety, but because her self-cited
quality was more socially related, she fell under the Low Self-Esteem category as
opposed to Anxiety.

22
was scored by giving one ‘point’ for each instance – an instance of Acknowledgement of
the Reader would be a rhetorical question such as “you know?” or other more direct
references to the reader. For example, one participant wrote that he was not comfortable
sharing facts about his family with a “you, a stranger” (i.e. me, the experimenter), which
was coded as an acknowledgement of the reader
Acknowledgement of Separate Selves
This measure captured the number of times the participant acknowledged separate
selves or identities based on varying social settings. For example, “with my family I’m
funny, but with my friends I’m a really good listener”. Each time the participant
specifically noted different ‘versions’ of themselves, they received a point. It is important
to note that different selves through time (i.e. “when I was little I was shy, but now I’m
outgoing”) did not count for this measure, because that tracks the individual’s ability to
recognize themselves and be self-reflective through time, whereas the current study is
more interested in the individual’s self-perception in the present and varying from setting
to setting. It is perhaps more typical of children to be able to reflect on the way they have
changed throughout time, as they are more equipped with the linguistic tools with which
to discuss it; as an individualist culture, we celebrate birthdays (marking the passage of
time) and encourage children to be ‘true to themselves’, meaning the only permissible
mode of change is throughout time, as opposed to throughout a party in different groups
of people. For these reasons among others, I chose to focus only on the less frequent
occasions in which children overtly recognize the influence of the social other upon the
way they present and perceive themselves.

23
Perception of the Self as Mediated Through the Other
Similar to the previous measure, the participant’s Perception of the Self as
Mediated Through the Other score was based on how many times he/she directly
mentions his/her view of himself/herself as mediated through another person. Examples
of this are, “my mom tells me I am funny”, or “all my friends say that I am rude.”
Though our self-perception is arguably inextricable from what others say about us,
participants received a point if they explicitly mentioned the way another person
perceived them. The most common format was, “Person X tells me I am Y”, or
“according to person X I am Y”.
“Black and White” Statements
This measure allotted a point for each statement a participant made that was
“black and white”, i.e. asserting something as completely right or as completely wrong.
These phrases were also referred to as statements of definitive morality, i.e. when a
participant made a blanket statement that did not take in to account any nuance or
variability. For example, “It’s wrong to lie and one never should”, or “people should
always be proud of who they are and never change for anyone else”.
Introspective Comments
As with the other measures, a participant received one point for each comment
made in this category. Introspective comments were more common in the older
participants, and were instances in which individuals demonstrated insight and selfreflection about his or her personality qualities or given examples. For example, “if I
could drop all of my worries I’m sure I’d be able to tackle a backflip [on] the trampoline”
(See Appendix K for this particular response, as well as example responses from students

24
in each grade) or “I see from writing that if I focus on my best quality I could probably
use it to work on the quality that I want to change.” The general format for such
statements was ‘a cognitive mechanism’ (“I think”, “I know”, “I believe”) plus ‘an
understanding of a cause-and-effect relationship’: “I think if X then Y”.
Self-Based Qualities versus Other-Based Qualities
The last and perhaps most data-rich measure recorded whether each student’s
positive and negative qualities were ‘self based’ or ‘other based’: in other words, was
their favorite personality quality treasured by them because it primarily affected
themselves (self-based) or because it primarily affected others (other-based)? Did they
want to change their negative quality because it primarily affected themselves or others?
For example, while two participants could both cite their best personality quality as being
“funny” and therefore be coded under the Humor category, participant A could say, “my
best personality quality is that I am funny, because it makes me the most popular kid in
my class”, while participant B could say, “my best personality quality is that I am funny,
because I can always cheer up my friends when they’re having a bad day.” Participant
A’s best quality is therefore coded as ‘self based’, i.e. mainly affecting himself, whereas
participant B is coded as ‘other based’, i.e. the quality is valued for how it can affect
other people.
Similarly, two participants could both write that the quality they want to change is
their tendency to procrastinate (and therefore be coded under the Expectation Violation
category), but while participant A says, “the quality that I would like to change is how
much I procrastinate because I don’t do my homework until too late and then I get
stressed and can’t sleep enough,” participant B writes, “the quality that I would like to

25
change is how much I procrastinate because I don’t do my chores on time and it really
upsets my mom because it makes it harder for her to do what she needs to do around the
house.” As before, participant A’s negative quality would be coded as ‘self based’, i.e.
primarily disrupting his comfort, and participant B would be ‘other based’, because his
motivation for wanting to change that quality is how it affects other people.
Relationship between Self-Based versus Other-Based qualities
This measure was used in two ways: the first way simply recorded one of the two
possible labels (“self” or “other”) for each of the two qualities (“positive” or “negative”).
This data was analyzed in various ways, as will be discussed further in the Results and
Discussion sections. The second way the measure was used was in assigning each
participant another label, almost like a ratio, that identified the relationship between their
positive quality and negative quality. In other words, if a participant had an other-based
positive quality and a self-based negative quality, she would be categorized as
“other:self”. The significance of said relationship will also be discussed further later on in
the chapter. Therefore, the possible categorizations each participant could receive are:
“self:other”, “self:self”, “other:self”, or “other:other”. It is important to note that the word
before the colon (“self” or “other”) refers always to the participant’s positive quality,
whereas the word after the colon (also “self” or “other”) refers always to the participant’s
negative quality. Thus, “self:other” is different than “other:self”. All individuals received
a categorization of this relationship, except for the few students who did not list either a
positive or a negative quality, due to inability to understand or complete the prompt.
Those participants were categorized as “self:n/a”, “other:n/a”, “n/a:other”, “n/a:self” or
“n/a:n/a” and were excluded from statistical tests. For example, an 8th grade female who

26
listed her best quality as “nice to almost everyone” (and therefore filed under the Helping
Others category) and the quality that she would like to change as “scared of a lot of stuff”
(and therefore filed under the Anxiety category) would be filed under the “other:self”
category, because her kindness affects others whereas she views her anxiety as only
affecting herself

Procedure
For the study, participants had 15 minutes to write an answer to a written prompt
and return their responses anonymously. The students were sent home with an
explanatory letter and permission slip prior to data collection (Appendix D), and an
additional explanatory email was sent to parent/guardians by the principal. Students who
were not given permission to participate remained in their classroom and completed an
alternate prompt generated by the student’s teacher; these responses were completed in
the same amount of time, were not collected, and were not used in data analysis.
As the experimenter, I entered the classroom and introduced myself and the
subsequent activity7. Two sheets of standardized lined paper8 provided by the teacher
were distributed to all participants. I then briefly explained the writing activity, handed
out the prompt face down, and asked participants to fill in their birthday (month and year
only) as well as their gender on the back of the prompt. Once that was completed, all
participants turned over the prompt and I led the group in reading the prompt out loud.
The prompt read, “What do you think is your best personality quality? What is a quality

See Appendix I for the verbal script. Two scripts were written and delivered: one script
for the younger participants in grades 2 and 5, and one script for the older participants in
grades 8 and 11.

Students in grade 5, 8, and 11 all used the same lined paper, while students in grade 2
used specialized paper with larger lines.

27
that you’d like to change? Explain your responses. Give two examples from your life –
one for each answer – in which you demonstrated each quality.” I allowed for questions
about the meaning of the prompt and the previously given instructions. For the younger
participants (2nd and 5th grade) more detail was given about what constituted a personality
quality vs. a physical quality, as well as the meaning of the words “anonymous” and
“demonstrate”. Once vocabulary was clarified and questions were answered, the writing
began.
The total writing period lasted 15 minutes; for previous studies using written
responses, the typical range of response time is 15-30 minutes (i.e. Pennebaker, 1997).
Less than 15 minutes would perhaps cut down on data because it would not allow for
enough time to think and write, whereas more than 15 minutes could potentially cut down
on data because of the young age of the participants, who would potentially lose focus
and motivation for completion. Though the older participants could have ostensibly
written for more than 15 minutes and thus produced more raw data, one time limit for all
ages was used in order to control for the effect of varying response time lengths. For the
2nd and 5th grade participants, the experimenter alerted them at the 7-minute mark and
encouraged them to move on to the second part of the prompt, i.e. the example-giving
section. This was done in order to collect data that addressed as much of the prompt as
possible. 8th and 11th grade students were only alerted when they had 7 minutes
remaining, and not urged to move on to the second part of the prompt; rather, they were
reminded to make sure they had addressed all sections of the prompt. In three of the four
grades, the only time students were spoken to during the study was to alert them of their

28
remaining time9. If participants finished early, they were asked to remain at their desks
until the experimenter told them otherwise10. At the end of the 15 minutes the
experimenter asked the students to stop writing, and staplers were passed out to attach all
the materials (written responses and information sheet). Responses were collected face
down, shuffled, and immediately deposited into a sealed folder, on which only the
collection date and the grade of the classroom was written. As I at no point had a copy of
a class list, there was no risk of violating confidentiality by placing a student’s response
in a folder with his or her grade on it.
This procedure was repeated nine times: once for the 2nd graders, once for the 5th
graders, four times for the 8th graders, and 3 times for the 11th graders. After the prompt
was administered and the data collected, the participants were able to ask any questions
they had about the process, etc., and were left with the my contact information11, as well
as the LIWC website (http://www.liwc.net). A follow up letter was sent to home to
parents the day of the experiment (See Appendix J) which further clarified the prompt,
procedure, and intended use of the data.

9

This procedure was intended to be standardized in all four grades, and was successfully
done so in three of them; it quickly became evident in the 2nd grade classroom that
students needed additional help. The alterations to the procedure and the potential
ramifications of said alteration will be discussed further in the ‘Limitations’ section of the
paper.
10
For the 2nd graders, the teacher stepped in unexpectedly and told children to draw on
the back of their responses if they were finished; while the potential ramifications of this
interjection will be discussed further in the ‘Limitations’ section of the paper, it perhaps
cut down on students’ responses. (See Appendix K for examples of the student’s
drawings)

None of the participants chose to follow up with the experimenter

Results
Age Differences: Overall Findings
As hypothesized, there were traceable patterns in both the categorical data and
LIWC data as the age of the participants increased. In keeping with previous data (i.e.
Buswell, 193712, NAEP, 197113) the average number of words per sentence (WPS)
increased over the four groups, with each subsequent grade averaging roughly 1, then 2,
then 3 WPS more than the previous: 2nd graders averaged 12.53 WPS, 5th graders 13.88
WPS, 8th graders 16.41 WPS and 11th graders with 18.96 WPS. Similarly, the average of
overall word count (WC) increased (32.67, 73.82, 136.5, 162.34 for 2nd, 5th, 8th, and 11th
grade respectively) as did the number of large (6 letters or greater) words.
Age Differences: Positive and Negative Qualities
As participants aged, they were more likely to cite their negative quality as one
that fell under the categorization of Anxiety: 0% of 2nd or 5th graders were labeled as
such, whereas 5.8% of the 8th graders and 8% of the 11th graders were. The frequency of
participants’ positive quality falling in the Tangible category decreased as they aged
(66.67% of 2nd graders, 12.5% of 5th graders, 8.7% of 8th graders, and 0% of 11th
graders), meaning fewer children cited their best personality quality as something
concrete like “learning to swim”, “doing tae kwon doe”, or “being tall”. 25% of the 2nd
graders didn’t fully answer the question, leaving out either a positive quality or a negative
quality (leading to a categorization of “n/a” or, “not applicable”), whereas none of the
12

University of Chicago Professor Guy Buswell conducted a series of tests assessing
reading skills in 1,000 adults with varying educational levels. He found that reading skills
and practices increase as years of education increase.
13
The National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) tested how students at age
9, 13 and 17, as well as adults 26-35 perform on various tasks. The results showed that
age affects performance on the same items. (Stitcht & Armstrong, 1994)

30
students in higher grades made the same error – mostly likely due to improved listening
and reading skills that come with age.
Also interesting is the ratio of positive qualities to negative qualities that each
student listed. While not statistically significant the average number of positive qualities
listed as well as the average number of negative qualities listed by each participant
increased; in the 2nd grade, students cited an average of 1.08 positive qualities and 1
negative quality; in the 5th grade, they cited an average of 1.19 positive qualities and 1.13
negative qualities; in the 8th grade 1.39 positive qualities and 1.23 negative qualities; and
in the 11th grade 1.78 positive qualities and 1.34 negative qualities. Therefore, the ratio of
positive to negative qualities increased as participants aged (1.08:1, 1.19:1.13, 1.39:1.23,
1.78:1.34), meaning that on average, the 2nd graders listed 1.08 times more positive
qualities than negative qualities, the 5th graders listed 1.05 times as more positive
qualities than negative qualities, the 8th graders listed 1.13 times more positive qualities
than negative qualities, and the 11th graders listed 1.33 times more positive qualities than
negative qualities.
Age Differences: Self-Based versus Other-Based qualities
While there was not a uniform increase or decrease across ages in self-based or
other-based qualities, participants were more likely to have their positive quality be
other-based as they aged: only 8% of 2nd graders cited their positive quality as such,
while 13% of 5th graders, 63% of 8th graders, and 70% of 11th graders did. Similarly,
there was a higher prevalence of participants who displayed the “other:self” relationship
as they aged; again, the other potential pattern combinations are “self:other”, “self:self”,

31
or “other:other. None of the 2nd or 5th graders displayed this particular relationship,
whereas 40.58% of the 8th grade and 54% of the 11th graders did.
Age Differences: LIWC Results
As sentence complexity increased -- as evidenced by more WPS, higher overall
WC -- the use of conjunctions (i.e. “and”, “but”, “whereas”) and cognitive processes (i.e.
“cause”, “know”, “ought”) also increased, yielding positive correlations with age of
participants (r = 0.323, r = 0.315 respectively, p < 0.01). Also 3rd person plural pronouns
(“they”) were significantly correlated with age (r = 0.311, p < 0.01). Many measures
decreased over time as well; in both males and females, positive emotion words were
negatively correlated with age (r = -0.398, p < 0.01), as were affective process words (i.e.
“happy”, “cried”, “abandon”) (r = -0.346, p < 0.01), and first person singular pronouns
(r = -0.416, p < 0.01).
Age Differences: 8th grade peaks
Though the other:other relationship increased as well as the other:self
relationship, the other:other relationship did not do so consistently, peaking in the 8th
grade: (0% of the 2nd or 5th grade demonstrated the other:other relationship, while 20.83%
of the 8th grade did, and only 16% of the 11th grade). In other words, nearly one fifth of
the 8th graders cited both their positive quality and their negative quality as other-based.
Other linguistic categories in which the 8th grade was highest were in the use of exclusive
words (“but”, “without”, “exclude”), insight words (“think”, “know”, “consider”),
biological processes (“eat”, “blood”, “pain”), and body words (“cheek”, “hands”, “spit”).
The categories of Expectation (9.72% of 8th graders) and Miscellaneous Good (8.33% of

32
8th graders) for positive quality and Overly Emotional (8.33% of 8th graders) for negative
quality were highest in the 8th grade as well.
In the last five measures of the conceptually derived coding system
(Acknowledgement of the Reader, Acknowledgement of Separate Selves, Perception of
the Self as Mediated Through the Other, “Black and White” statements, and Introspective
Comments), 8th graders had the highest occurrence of each. For Acknowledgement of the
Reader, the scores were 0 instances in the 2nd grade, 0 in the 5th grade, 16 in the 8th grade,
and 8 in the 11th grade. For Acknowledgment of Separate Selves, the scores were 0, 3, 9,
and 7 (for 2nd, 5th, 8th, and 11th grade respectively); for Perception of Self as Mediated
Through the Other, the scores were 0, 4, 21, 13; for “Black and White” statements, the
scores were 0, 1, 27, and 12; and for Introspective comments the scores were 0, 1, 36, and
28.

Gender Differences
Gender Differences: Positive and Negative Qualities
While differences among age accounted for much of the significant data,
differences between genders yielded just as many findings. When collapsed across age,
girls tended to be categorized under the Optimism and Helping Others categories for their
positive qualities14 with about three times as many girls as boys falling into the Optimism
category (22.97% of girls versus 6.97% of boys) and about twice as many into Helping
Others (32.43% of girls versus 15.28% of boys). For negative qualities15, girls were about
three times as likely as boys to be classified in the category of Low Self-Esteem (32.43%
of girls versus 11.11% of boys) and nearly nine times as likely to be in the Overly
14
15

For a complete breakdown of girls’ negative qualities see Appendix A, Figure 4

33
Emotional category (10.81% of girls versus 1.39% of boys). Boys were roughly two and
a half times more likely than girls to cite Humor as their positive quality16 (30.56% of
boys versus 12.16% of girls as well as Impulse Control as their negative17 quality
(45.83% of boys versus 18.92% of girls) Boys were also about two and a quarter times
more likely than girls to list their positive quality as something Tangible (15.28% of boys
versus 6.76% of girls), and two and a half times more likely to list their negative quality
as Tangible (13.89% of boys versus 5.41% of girls). Additionally, 0% of girls explicitly
stated that they did not want to change18 while 2.78% of boys did. In the reverse, 1.35%
of girls did not list a positive quality, whereas 0% of the boys did.
The number of female participants who were categorized as Helping Others for
their positive quality increased over the four grades more dramatically than in male
participants (14.29% of 2nd grade girls, 14.29% of 5th grade girls, 34.29% of 8th grade
girls, and 40% of 11th grade girls), though the boys too showed a similar pattern (0% of
2nd grade boys, 0% of 5th grade boys, 14.71% of 8th grade boys, 24% of 11th grade boys).
Female participants were also more likely to be categorized under the Low Self-Esteem
or Anxiety category as they aged: in the Low Self-Esteem group were 28.57% of 2nd
grade girls, 28.57% of 5th grade girls, 34.29% of 8th grade girls, and 36% of 11th grade
girls. For Anxiety, 0% of 2nd grade girls fell into that category, 0% of 5th grade girls,
5.71% of 8th grade girls, and 12% of 11th grade girls. Again, male participants increased
in citing Low Self-Esteem as a quality that they would like to change too (0% of 2nd

34
grade boys, 0% of 5th grade boys, 11.76% of 8th grade boys, and 16% of 11th grade boys),
but their increase was not as steep as the female population’s.
Gender Differences: Self-Based versus Other-Based qualities
The large majority of girls had an other-based positive quality (72%) and a selfbased negative quality (70.67%), as opposed to the less striking majority of boys, who
had a self-based positive quality (57.53%) and a self-based negative quality (53.42%).
Thus, more than half of the female participants had an other:self relationship (52%)19, as
opposed to roughly one fifth of the male participants (21.92%)20. Boys were much more
evenly divided across the self-based or other-based positive and negative quality
relationship categories, with 21.92% of them falling under the other:self relationship as
well as the self:other relationship, 15.07% of them exhibiting an other:other relationship,
and the largest percentage of them (31.51%) exhibiting a self:self relationship21. Girls
were much less equally distributed: more than half (52%) exhibited an other:self
relationship, 9.33% exhibited a self:other relationship, 17.33% fell under the other:other
relationship, and 14.67% under the self:self relationship.22
While the “other:self” relationship increased overall, it did so more dramatically
in girls as they aged, leaping from 0% in both the 2nd and 5th grade to 51.43% of the 8th
grade and 64% of the 11th grade. In contrast, boys increased in the other:self relationship
from 0% in 2nd and 5th grade to 29.41% in 8th grade and 44% in 11th grade. As boys aged,
19

See Appendix A, Figure 7
See Appendix A, Figure 8
21
The remaining 8.22% of them were categorized under the “n/a” category, which meant
that part of the prompt was answered incorrectly and therefore either a positive or a
negative quality was not listed, their response completely defied categorization of “other”
or “self” based, or lastly they explicitly listed that they did not want to change and thus
could not be filed as “other” or “self” based.
22
The remaining 5.33% of girls were categorized under the “n/a” category.
20

35
they were less likely to have a self-based positive quality paired with a self-based
negative quality (self:self relationship), decreasing from 40% of 2nd grade boys, to
33.33% of 5th grade boys, to 29.41% of 8th grade boys to 20% of 11th grade boys. In
addition, the likelihood of boys having a self-based positive quality decreased over time,
with 100% of 2nd grade boys citing such, 88.89% of 5th grade boys, 50% of 8th grade
boys, and 48% of 11th grade boys. Girls also increased in citing their positive quality as
other-based as they aged (14.29% of 2nd grade girls, 28.57% of 5th grade girls, 82.86% or
8th grade girls, and 88% of 11th grade girls) and increased in citing their negative quality
as self-based (42.86% of 2nd and 5th grade girls, 74.29% of 8th grade girls, and 80% of
11th grade girls).
Gender Differences: Additional Conceptually-Derived Measures
Boys and girls also differed in the last five measures of the conceptually derived
coding system (Acknowledgement of the Reader, Acknowledgement of Separate Selves,
Perception of the Self as Mediated Through the Other, “Black and White” statements,
and Introspective Comments). See Appendix A, Figure 2. Acknowledgement of the
reader was about equal, with girls accounting for 58.3% of the occurrences (14 of 24) and
boys accounting for 41.67% (10 of 24). Acknowledgement of Separate Selves was also
more evenly split, with girls accounting for 42.4% and boys for 57.89%. However, the
Perception of the Self as Mediated Through the Other differed between boys and girls:
girls accounted for 65.79% of all instances, and boys for only 34.2%. Similarly, “Black
and White” statements were split between girls and boys 62.5% (girls) and 37.5% (boys),
and Introspective comments were split 66.2% for girls and 33.8% for boys.

36
Gender Differences: LIWC results
To assess statistically significant differences in word use between boys and girls,
independent t-tests were performed. Across all four age groups girls and boys differed
significantly in use of ‘ingestion words’ (i.e. “dish”, “eat”, “pizza”) (t(10) =.07, t(15)
=.00 , t(48) = .024, t(149) = 0.13, for grades 2, 5, 8, and 11, respectively) and
‘achievement words’ (i.e. “earn”, “hero”, “win”) (t(10) = .00 , t(15) = .003 , t(48) = .013,
t(149)= 0.22, for grades 2, 5, 8, and 11, respectively) though more gender differences
were found when the data was divided by grade as well as and gender. In grades 2, 5, and
8, girls and boys differed in ‘family’ words (t(10) = .000, t(15) = .020, t(48) = .029, for
grades 2, 5 and 8 respectively) and ‘home’ words ( t(10) = .009, t(15) = .001, t(48) =
.018, for grades 2, 5 and 8 respectively); in grades 5, 8, and 11, girls and boys differed in
sadness words (t(15) = .004, t(48) =.002, t(149) = .050 for grades 5, 8, and 11
respectively), use of question marks (t(15) = .001, t(48) = .003, t(149) = .003 for grades
5, 8, and 11 respectively), and health words (t(15) = .000, t(48) = .034, t(149) = .030 for
grades 5, 8, and 11 respectively); in grades 2 and 5, girls and boys differed in social
words (t(10) = .035, t(15) = .023), anxiety words (t(10) = .002, t(15) = .000), tentative
words (t(10) = .007, t(15) = .001), and work related words (t(10) = .022, t(15) = .003); in
grades 5 and 8 girls and boys differed in word count (t(15) = .007, t(48) = .035), use of
second person pronouns (t(15) = .001, t(48) = .000), numbers (t(15) = .001, t(48) = .037),
inclusive words (t(15) =.003, t(48) =.005), and biological process words (t(15) = .017,
t(48) = .011); and in grades 5 and 11, girls and boys differed in future tense verb use
(t(15) = .016, t(149) =.033), adverb use (t(15 )= .027, t(149) = .042), body words (t(15) =

37
.008, t(149) = .026), space words (t(15) = .000, t(149) = .052), and money words (t(15) =
.005, t(149) =.000).

Discussion
Discussion: Age Differences
Though the current findings are due to a blend of myriad influences, the most
striking factor in shaping responses appears to be social awareness; as we age and as
social awareness develops the value of peer approval increases. we are adaptive beings,
and as awareness and the need for approval from the other increases, childhood and
adolescent self-concept adapts to fit that context. First person singular pronouns were
significantly negatively correlated with age (r = - 0.416, p < 0.01), suggesting both
increasing syntactic complexity as well as a shift of focus: as the individual ages, he or
she moves away from a view of the self as an isolated being, and towards a view of the
self as part of a larger social context. Third person pronouns are also positively correlated
with age, which, when coupled with increased use of cognitive words, supports the notion
of a heightened awareness of participants’ social context as they grow older. Similarly,
the other:self relationship increased consistently across the four grades, suggesting not
just a heightened recognition of the social sphere but particularly the individual’s place in
relation to that sphere; because children rely more heavily on peer evaluation as they age
(i.e. Montemayor and Eisen, 1977), they increasingly define themselves in comparison to
those social relationships (particularly group membership), hence taking pride in
positively affecting them.
However, with this growing awareness of social roles and social rules comes
knowledge of peer judgment, which leads to decreased self esteem; though perhaps

38
counterintuitive, escalating acknowledgment of the outside world causes increased
introspection - the question ‘how am I viewed by my peers?’ grows louder, and it is
therefore logical that as social status becomes the tool with which children and
adolescents begin to forge their identities, they look outward for approval (hence the
other-based positive quality) and inward for improvement (hence the self-based negative
quality). The increased awareness of the self as the subject of observation and evaluation
is also likely the cause of increased use of words in the ‘see’ category, such as “view”,
“saw”, and “seen”. Children begin to establish themselves first as different from the
physical environment and then as different from the social (i.e. Lewis, 1990), and as they
develop metacognition and the ability to be self-reflective (i.e. Fox and Riconscente,
2008) that heightened awareness may lead to more observational and perspective taking
words.
Positive emotion words were negatively correlated with age (r = -0.398, p < 0.01)
and anger words positive correlated echoing the decrease in self-esteem and the increase
in anxiety, trends most likely due to increased social demands. The increase in negative
words as well as the decrease in affective process words reveals that a ramification of
being thrust into the realm of social scrutiny as one ages leads to a more guarded
relationship of one’s emotions. Participants perhaps became more aware of their inner
emotions and cognitive processes as they aged (as evidenced by increased use of words in
the ‘cognitive mechanisms’ category), but they also became more aware of outward
displays of emotion and other affective processes. As children get older their sense of self
becomes less disparate, and rather than identifying as someone who cries and then laughs
and then yells, a comprehensive image of a complex emotional being emerges; as

39
children aged, affective process words decreased, which is ostensibly explained by a
dwindling need for explicitly stating affective processes in writing that explores selfimage. In other words, rather than saying “I am sad”, the individual can show that
emotion through their writing, rather than telling it. This is due to increased writing skills,
as well as increased Theory of Mind; as children age, they are better able to take other
people’s perspectives and in turn expect others to take theirs. This ability of the reader to
understand the basic motivators of the storyteller is part of the magic in storytelling (i.e.
Zunshine, 2003).
Similarly, more than half of the 2nd graders prided themselves on a Tangible skill
like “singing” or “playing football” as opposed to 0% of the 11th graders, who are able to
draw a distinction between ‘who they are’ and ‘what they do’. This is perhaps due in part
to the older participants’ enhanced ability to understand the prompt (i.e. understand what
a ‘personality’ quality is, rather than a ‘skill’ or a ‘physical quality’), but more likely is in
keeping with the evolution of the child’s self-concept from concrete and physical to more
abstract and cognitive (i.e. Werner, 1957). As children age they form a more complex
self-concept, and rather than identifying with more concrete skills they have, they begin
to value and define themselves through their unique personal attributes. Similarly, the
number of positive qualities and the number of negative qualities that participants
reported increased, suggesting both a greater linguistic ability (when an individual’s
vocabulary is larger, there is a higher likelihood of that individual using a greater variety
of words) as well as a more complex and nuanced view of the self, one that requires
multiple descriptors. Also interesting to note is that despite the increase in Anxiety and
Low Self-Esteem and the decrease in positive emotion words, on the whole, participants

40
consistently listed slightly more positive qualities than negative qualities. This could be
due to a generally positive self-image, or due to the ordering of the prompt, in which
students were asked to first describe their best personality quality and then which one
they would want to change.
Discussion: 8th Grade Peaks
As listed in the results section, the 8th grade showed particularly high occurrences
of most measures, suggesting a ‘spike’ or rapid increase between 5th and 8th grade, which
evened out in the 11th grade data. The intense increases demonstrated during these years
can be explained by many previous findings, both biological and psychological. During
early adolescence, puberty begins, and some findings suggest that “pubertal age is more
accurate than chronological age” (Gurian, 2012) in predicting emotional states such as
stress or depression. Hormones are raging, which affect mood as well as where attention
is directed – i.e. towards peers, and often through a sexual lens. A similarly social reason
for the unique findings in the 8th grade was introduced by David Elkind in 1967:
adolescent egocentrism. Elkind defines adolescent egocentrism in two parts, the
imaginary audience (the adolescent’s tendency to believe that everyone is watching and
judging him or her) and the personal fable (the adolescent’s belief that he or she is
“unique, invulnerable, and omnipotent” (Vartanian, 2000)). A more recent study however
suggests that “adolescents worry about what other people think because there are real
personal and social consequences. Such concerns are seen as being based in social reality
and are not imaginary as Elkind suggested” (Bell and Bromnick, 2003).

Discussion: Gender Differences
Overwhelmingly, the data showed that girls seemed to have the social ‘other’ in
mind more often than boys; not only did they have more other-based qualities, but also
increased instances of appearing in the Anxiety, Low Self-Esteem, and Overly Emotional
categories. The data are supported by other findings: according to the NYU Child Study
Center, “about 10 – 15 % of all children report moderate to severe signs of depression.
By age 13, a dramatic shift occurs, and more than twice as many girls as boys are
depressed, a proportion that persists into adulthood. This two-to-one ration exists
regardless of racial or ethnic background and has been reported in other countries”
(Gurian, 2012). Additionally, girls accounted for 65.79% of the instances of Perception of
Self as Mediated Through the Other and more frequently used ingestion words. These
findings point to a perhaps painfully heightened awareness of the self as the object of
evaluation, particularly in the light of behavioral and physical female stereotypes: around
puberty, “girls view body changes, such as increased fat layers, as negative. Boys, on the
other hand, view body changes, such as increased muscular development, as positive”
(Gurian, 2012).
The data are ostensibly due in part to the larger cultural pressures that face girls
and young women; girls are taught to be both selfless but self assured, beautiful but not
conceited, health conscious but not self conscious, fun but hardworking. It would be
naïve to say that boys do not face social pressures, though arguably young girls are
bombarded daily with more concrete roles to which they must adhere. The number of
female participants who were categorized as Helping Others (14.29% in 2nd grade,
14.29% in 5th, 34.29% in 8th, and 40% in 11th) increased over the four grades more

42
dramatically than in male participants, though boys showed a similar pattern too (0%,
0%, 14.71%, 24%). Because girls and women are socialized to be helpful, maternal, and
giving, this increase in girls under the Helping Other category supports cultural
stereotypes and expectations. As girls get older, they are both trained to fulfill a certain
idealized image of femininity and more aware of what they should be; an interesting
mediating factor to take in to account is that some of these trends are due to participant
bias or the social desirability bias, and perhaps girls do not increase in benevolence and
Helping Others, but rather are more aware of their audience and understand how to
answer ‘correctly’.
Another explanation could be that girls are often more socially aware than boys
are at a young age, and it is not that the amount of pressure they face is higher, but they
simply are more aware of it. It could also be argued that both boys and girls face similar
amounts of pressure but girls are taught to be or are more naturally susceptible to social
criticism and praise (i.e. Blakemore, 2003); perhaps the root of many gender differences
is simply a taught valuing or disregarding of social criticism. Girls are taught to please
others and be valued mainly in how they affect other people, whereas boys are
encouraged to be independent, strong, and base their self-worth on what they individually
can accomplish. Nearly twice as many boys as girls (15.28% vs. 6.76%) fell under the
skill-based positive quality, supporting the notion that culturally, young boys value
themselves based on what they accomplish, often individually, versus what they do to
affect others on a daily basis. Also in support of this hypothesis is that boys and girls
differed significantly on achievement words, with more boys than girls employing them.

43
More than twice as many boys (58.33% vs. 22.97%) had a self-based positive
quality, and twice as many boys than girls also had a “self:self” relationship (31.94% vs.
14.86%), meaning both their positive and negative qualities mainly affected themselves.
This data is in keeping with previous research by Stapley and Haviland (1989), who
found that references to other-direction negative emotions, such as anger, were
predominant of boys, and inner-directed negative emotions, such as sadness, fear, guilt,
and shame, were characteristic of girls. It is also interesting to consider that there may be
some similarity between boys and girls, and some of the differences found in the data are
due to linguistic differences between the genders rather than inherent behavioral
differences; for example, while only 18.67% of girls (as opposed to 45.21% of boys)
were placed under the Impulse Control category, another 21.33% were under Expectation
Violation. Within Expectation Violation, the majority of girls who landed there cited
“bossiness” as the quality they would like to change, whereas the most common answers
for boys under the Impulse Control category were “too competitive” or “get angry too
easily” or “get frustrated too easily”; in other words, though the categorization of
“competitiveness” versus “bossiness” was different, they are arguably different
manifestations of the same thing: childhood and adolescent aggression. “While both boys
and girls engage in relational aggression, girls tend to use more indirect, social and verbal
forms of aggression….boys are more likely to express their aggression as an impulse act”
(Meichenbaum, 2006). Because I am interested in language as a mediating factor in selfconcept, this gender-influenced linguistic difference in describing what is perhaps the
same quality (childhood aggression) is a particularly rich finding.

44

Limitations
Though the study was designed and implemented to the best of my ability, there
were of course inevitable limitations, some of which were inherent in the measures
employed and others that arose during data collection or data analysis.
Limitations: Study Design
In the overall ideology of the study, I relied on participants’ word choice to lend
insight into their self-concept; however, as Tausczik and Pennebaker (2010) point out,
“the imprecise measurement of word meaning and psychological states themselves
should give pause to anyone who relies too heavily on accurately detecting people’s true
selves through their use of words.” Nevertheless, I strove in this study to eliminate as
much of this ‘imprecision’ as possible by creating a supplementary measure to LIWC as
well as confining the intent of the study to exploring children’s own self-concept as
specifically mediated by language, as opposed to attempting to glean a more objective
view of childhood identity; while it is worth quoting Tausczik and Pennebaker’s warning
and acknowledging the degree of interpretation present in this study, not only do I not
feel that there is more ‘guesswork’ in this study than in others, but my intention was also
to specifically study the words children choose when describing themselves. Namely, my
goal was never to analyze the ‘true’ nature of each participant, but rather to study the
linguistic lens through which they choose to present themselves. In that sense, it is more a
study of the representation of childhood and adolescent self-concept by children and
adolescents through language. Therefore, the language studied in this procedure did get at
a truth, the truth of the way each child represents him or herself.

45
Another potential limitation of this study was my employment of the crosssectional method. Ideally, the study would have been longitudinal, in order to eliminate
variables of individual participants; in other words, participant A in grade 5 might be
inherently more energetic than participant B in grade 11 and therefore participant A
might have issues with impulse control throughout his life, whereas even when
participant B was in grade 5, he never had the same strengths and limitations. However, if
I were able to track participant A throughout his life (ideally in every grade, though for
the sake of discussing a parallel study, in 2nd, 5th, 8th, and 11th grade), the potential
changes throughout his development (i.e. improvement of his impulse control or
transference of his energy into academic work ethic) would more likely be due to aging
than to other variables, as is the case in the current design in which each grade is intended
to be representative of children that age (though of course there are individual
differences).
Also inherent in the study design are the limitations that come along with any
single participant population. The town in which I conducted my research -- Rhinebeck,
New York -- is a relatively affluent town, where the cost of living is 126% of the national
average, the violent crime index is as low as it gets (1), and the public schools are rated
by GreatSchools between an 8-9 out of 1023 In order to ensure that this study’s results
have external validity (i.e. that they can be generalized to the greater population), I would
ideally replicate it in other populations with varying qualifications (i.e. higher and lower
SES, public versus private schools, single-sex schools, religious schools, homeschooled

23

Chancellor Livingston Elementary and Rhinebeck Senior High School both have
ratings of 8, while Bulkeley Middle School has a rating of 9. This rating is based on its
public schools’ test results, as compared to those of other schools in the state

46
children, bilingual children, non-native children, etc.). The particular environments in
which the study was conducted appeared to be particularly focused on helping each
individual child, in whatever their academic needs were as well as in fostering their selfexpression. In a different setting in which creative personal expression was not as
encouraged, I imagine the results would vary slightly, though I believe the significant
findings discovered in this study would hold true.
Lastly, the phrasing of the actual prompt may have been difficult to understand
for various students, specifically the youngest population of 2nd graders. (“What do you
think is your best personality quality? What is a quality that you’d like to change?
Explain your responses. Give two examples from your life – one for each answer – in
which you demonstrated each quality.”) Many did not understand the word
“demonstrate”, despite having explained the prompt in the script before the timed
responses began.
Limitations: Measures
Though LIWC is a fantastic program, I touched on some of its limitations earlier
in the chapter; it does not take into account word-order, slang, or context, though an
experimenter could go in and create a new dimension in which to capture various trends
if need be. Also worth noting are the populations with which the majority of the research
was done in creating LIWC: “more of the research results have come from labs in the
United States working with college-aged students, often in highly contrived settings”
(Tausczik & Pennebaker, 2010). The researchers also point out that “the relevant social
information can vary greatly between language and cultures…indeed, some of the most
striking cultural differences in language -- such as markers of politeness, formality, and

47
social closeness -- are inherent in function words rather than content words (Boroditsky,
Schmidt & Phillips, 2003)” As mentioned earlier, the study would be stronger if both the
creators of LIWC as well as myself studied varying populations.
Because of LIWC’s limitations, I created the more categorical means of analyzing
the data, though that system had various flaws as well. In any coding system, it is ideal to
have more than one judge both in creating the system as well as in analyzing the data -unfortunately for this study I was the sole designer, experimenter and data analyst, and
therefore if there was any ambiguity in judging which category a participant belonged in,
I made the only and final call. While I did so carefully and thoughtfully, it would be
naïve to ignore the inevitable human subjectivity in data analysis, and had another judge
been present, perhaps a few categories would be different.
Limitations: Data Collection
While data collection proceeded more or less as planned, there were a few
unexpected occurrences that potentially influenced the data. Though there were set scripts
(one for the 2nd and 5th grade, one for the 8th and 11th grade. See Appendix I), as the
experimenter I occasionally had to be flexible. Procedure went as expected in the 5th, 8th,
and 11th grade, but the 2nd grade presented a few hiccups to the script and well laid out
procedure. The classroom’s teacher took more control than previously expected,
occasionally giving the students alternate instructions; though these did not compromise
the data terribly, it made it difficult to standardize the procedure as firmly as I originally
intended. In particular, the teacher told the students to draw on the back of their responses
when they had finished. While this made for some very cute additions to the written
prompt (see Appendix L for examples), it also potentially cut down on students’

48
responses. In addition, many of the 2nd graders needed individual attention when
answering the prompt, either because they were unable to fully comprehend the prompt (a
phrasing issue that, were the study to be replicated, I would address), or because they
were used to checking with the teacher before declaring an assignment completed.
Because of this, both the teacher and I spoke to individual students throughout the 15
minute response time, and while I endeavored to answer the students’ questions without
compromising the data collection (i.e. without revealing the intent of the study, etc.), I
was unable to keep track of all the teacher said to the students, and there is a possibility
that she inadvertently goaded the participants in a specific direction.
In the 5th grade classroom, the majority of the participants responded that their
favorite quality was Humor and the quality that they wanted to change was either Impulse
Control or Expectation Violation; what is worth commenting on however is that most of
them specifically said “I am funny but I am bossy”, the exact example I used in the script.
Though I standardized this example for all four grades in order to illustrate what was
meant by the prompt, this seemed to influence the 5th graders much more strongly than
any of the other grades. An alternative would have been to not present an example, but I
feared that that would lead confusion which would influence the data more strongly than
the imitation of the example given.
Lastly, each time I administered the prompt I remained in the classroom, and I
would be curious to explore the effect of the experimenter’s presence in the room while
participants are asked to anonymously answer an extremely personal prompt. It would
have been interesting to divide each grade into two parts, one in which I remained in the
classroom and one in which I waited outside. Similarly, the presence of the students’

49
teacher as well as the answering of the prompt in their own classroom ostensibly affected
the data as well; just as many students acknowledged a reader or described different
‘versions’ of themselves in different social settings, perhaps their responses and word
choices would have varied slightly had they been in a more neutral space (i.e. if they are
failing English and answered the prompt in their English classroom, they might have
cited different positive and negative qualities than if they had been in their math
classroom, where they are maintaining an “A” average). Other scenarios to explore would
be: had they been told that I was simply the deliverer of the prompt and would not be the
one reading them, had they typed their responses on the computer and thus eliminated the
potentially identifying factor of handwriting, had they spoken rather than written their
responses, etc.

Future Directions
While I consider the study a great success, there is a multitude of ways in which
this process could be tweaked and/or built upon for further exploration. As far as the
measure of LIWC goes, Tausczik and Pennebaker (2010) cite it as “only a transitional
text analysis program in the shift from traditional language analysis to a new era of
language analysis. ... Studies have begun to look at n-grams, groups of two or more
words together in the same way we have used LIWC to look at frequencies of single
words (Oberlander & Gill, 2006).” If and when these new types of language processing
computer programs are available, it would be worthwhile to replicate the current study,
along with the previously noted adjustments (i.e. with different populations, as a
longitudinal study, with or without the presence of the experimenter, etc.). Similarly,
little research has been done investigating the difference between written and spoken

50
language – I would be interested in replicating the current study (i.e. administering the
same prompt) but asking each participant to speak the answer, either to me in an
interview setting, or recorded alone at home.
I also believe that there is tremendous therapeutic value in my findings, and
modifications of this study can be used in other capacities. As Pennebaker (2007) has
shown, introspective personal writing has direct health benefits, and I believe that if
children (both of typical and atypical development and circumstance) were assigned or
encouraged to keep personal journals, they too would have physical and mental health
improvements. Not only would regular writing improve each child’s vocabulary and
writing skills, but becoming familiar with emotional vocabulary would increase
emotional awareness, emotional self-regulation, and emotional ‘intelligence’ as well,
leading to more well-adjusted children. Even when one is writing for oneself in a journal,
diary, or writing prompt, there is a perception of an audience, and for children who do not
get enough attention on a daily basis, this imagined reader or built in ‘safe space’ of
journal writing is bound to have discernible benefits. It is also important for children to
take the time to think about themselves in the way this study demanded, both to bring
into practice and thus increase abilities of meta-cognition, but also to begin to be more in
touch with one’s own thoughts and desires. This self-knowledge can lead to better
decision-making and overall happiness, for if a child understands him or herself, he or
she is more likely to make choices that benefit him or herself.
Less abstract uses of this current study are potential screening techniques -- as
Stirman and Pennebaker (2011) showed, suicidal and depressed individuals tended to use
more negative emotion words and more first-person singular pronouns; if this type of

51
self-reflective writing was mandatory a few times a school year every year, teachers and
administrators could ostensibly screen children and adolescents for depression issues,
getting appropriate help to children who otherwise may not receive it. In this particular
study, one 8th grade girl identified herself as “suicidal” -- though the girl’s teacher and
guidance counselor were both already aware of her battle with depression, they were
grateful to have the information on file and keep track of her emotional progress. Another
use of the current study could be to supplement personality tests (i.e. the Myers-Briggs
test) or to adapt them to be personality tests more appropriate for children than the
current lengthy queries. Though no correlational tests were performed, by eyeballing the
data it appeared that in many participants, their positive or negative quality was
predictive of the other; for example, many children who cited Humor as their best quality
also cited Impulse Control as their negative (i.e. Appendix J, response #4 and #7), or
participants who cited “loyalty” (Expectation) as their best quality identified their
negative quality as having “trust issues” (Overly Emotional) (i.e. Appendix J, response
#6). In other words, it appears that the current study began to unearth distinct personality
types in children – those who pride themselves in their humor perhaps enjoy being the
center of attention and thrive on peer approval, and therefore have boundary issues
understanding when to stop sacrificing rule obedience for comedic effect. If parents,
teachers, and peers better understood this personality ‘type’ or ‘trait’, different and
ostensibly more effective approaches to discipline could be employed. Similarly, with the
child who is both loyal to her friends and mistrustful of others, it is evident that social
relationships are extremely important to the way she conducts her life and organizes her
world. In both cases, if one understands the child’s motivation for behavior, one is better

52
able to cater to that child’s individual needs. It would be fascinating to hone in on the
measures that most accurately gauge or predict childhood personality type and expand
upon them, allowing for the creation of a more accurate, open-ended, and youth-friendly
tool with which to understand and help our children.

Chapter 2: Aesthetic Representation
We are not born complete. Both physically and intellectually, the majority of our
development takes place outside the womb, in harmony with and reaction to our
surroundings. In the first few months of life infants double their weight, gain control of
their eyes, head, and neck and soon begin to grasp objects. While this physical
development progresses at a steady and predictable rate, social, emotional, and
intellectual development tends to as well; babies coo, smile, imitate, and begin to form
basic social relationships with those around them. These developmental milestones can
be observed, and until the child acquires language, it is through observation alone that we
are able to assure that they are following an age-appropriate track and recognize them as
developmentally typical; in other words, until they can speak for themselves, they are
defined entirely by others, and by what they do rather than what they think.
Pre-linguistically, the child is ‘a girl’ or ‘a boy’, ‘14 months’ or ‘3 years’ old,
‘appropriately mobile’ or ‘atypically still’. Occasionally he or she is defined by his or her
preferences, such as laughter at the sight of cartoons and tears at the sound of the
vacuum. Still, these basic identities are assigned to young children, surmised by the
observer based on tangible evidence. Early language is based largely on imitation, and
even when speaking ability is obtained it is often with ‘inherited’ words that children
self-define. Before the development of metacognition, children mimic the way they hear
themselves being talked about, and often self-describe in terms of what they do rather
than what they think. Parents know their young children through observing actions and
reactions, and therefore young children know themselves through their parents and their
parents’ reported assessments. How, then, do children begin to form their own identities,

54
and transcend the labels stamped upon them? Are new identities created independent of,
in opposition to, or in conjunction with the others that previously defined them? Does
identity evolution, like physical development, also follow a discernible path?
I will explore these questions in the following chapter, drawing on a variety of
diverse sources to explore the intricacies of identity formation. While my primary
reference points will be two novels – The Waves by Virginia Woolf and A Portrait of the
Artist as a Young Man by James Joyce – I will also rely on developmental psychology
theorists to support the account of childhood development put forth by the novelists. My
intent in combining the two different approaches is not to compare and contrast one
approach’s findings with the other, but rather to put them in dialogue with one another,
combining forces to investigate childhood identity construction. The guiding
psychological principles that I will be adhering to in this chapter come from Abraham
Maslow and Philippe Rochat, though I will periodically reference empirical studies that
give weight to the point being discussed – I find this solidifies the connection between
psychological exploration and literary exploration, highlighting the validity in both
endeavors. I will be using Maslow and Rochat’s developmental theories as lenses through
which I analyze the perspectives offered by Woolf and Joyce, and the additional, almost
anecdotal empirical references reinforce the real world correlations between what the
novels declare is ‘true’ and what we as people (and not characters in a novel) experience.
I will therefore be moving fluidly among the five or so sources – The Waves, A Portrait
of the Artist as a Young Man, Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs, Rochat’s 5 levels of selfawareness, and miscellaneous studies and theories (i.e. the visual cliff, Maternal Facial
Signaling, Violation of Expectation, and the Cocktail Party Effect) – suggesting that

55
though each source differs in the orientation of its argument, each illuminates a unique
aspect of the large picture of childhood and adolescent identity formation.

The Value of Empirical Research and Aesthetic Representation
In the specific case of childhood and adolescent identity formation, both an
objective and a subjective perspective are necessary to build a full picture of the
experience. By collecting first-person non-fiction writing samples from children, I
explore the experience from the inside out, gleaning a purely subjective viewpoint to
meld in with the rest. Personal narration is invaluable when endeavoring to paint an entire
picture of childhood, though there are of course certain limitations to relying solely on
the self-report of those still deeply steeped in active identity formation. For this reason, I
also draw on arguably more objective means of understanding this distinctive time
period, referencing psychology studies and theories that ostensibly analyze the
experience from a removed, standardized, and quantitative outlook. This outside-lookingin standpoint ideally eliminates the subjective biases of someone still experiencing the
situation he or she is attempting to describe, though there is potentially something lost in
boiling individual experience down to a numerical average.
The ideal midpoint between subjective personal narrative and objective,
impersonal survey then, is the novel: the unique format allows the author to toy with the
line between objectivity and subjectivity. However, it is important to keep in mind a
novel is a creative representation of an experience. Though there is tremendous value in
the innovative and insightful depiction of various experiences, it must not be mistaken for
pure objectivity, as there is a human author with specific motives in the writing of the
book. Regardless, the artistic license of the author allows him or her to bring to life long

56
forgotten aspects of childhood, creating a space in which childhood experience is either
revived or born for the reader – the profundity of artistic representation is that readers or
audience members can both identify with a feeling the art recalls to them (i.e. they
vividly recall an experience they had because they see aspects of it reflected in the art) or
they can experience something for the first time through the power of the creative
narration (i.e. they have never befriended a wealthy, love-sick bootlegger as is the case
with Nick in The Great Gatsby, but they understand the complexity and tenderness that
characterizes the relationship by reading the novel). As Woolf herself says, “the writer
must get into touch with his reader by putting before him something which he recognizes,
which therefore stimulates his imagination, and makes him willing to cooperate in the far
more difficult business of intimacy” (Woolf, 1923).
Novels target emotional knowledge, combining the inside-looking-out with the
outside-looking-in perspectives. Both Joyce and Woolf take advantage of this freedom of
perspective in different ways; in The Waves, Woolf writes six different subjective, insidelooking-out perspectives, all combining to form a magnificent but implicitly objective
view, while Joyce focuses on one character. The majority of A Portrait is outsidelooking-in – i.e. omniscient narration – but as the main character ages and becomes a
more self-actualized individual, capable of having his own thoughts and making his own
decisions, the narration symbolically changes to first-person, or subjective narration,
inside-looking-out. Both works expertly use the freedoms allowed by fiction writing to
bring home emotional truths to the reader – the magic in the writing is partially due to the
authors’ ability to ‘show’ and not simply ‘tell’ the trials and tribulations of childhood.

57
Why Modernist Literature?
“And now I will hazard a[n] assertion,” Woolf said in her 1923 essay, Mr. Bennet
and Mrs. Brown, “to the effect that in or about December, 1910, human character
changed” (Woolf, 1). More specifically, Woolf is referring to the emergence of the
Modernist movement, a gradual shift in cross-cultural consciousness that manifested
itself in art and literature. “I am not saying that one went out, as one might into a garden,
and there saw that a rose had flowered, or that a hen had laid an egg,” she continues.
“The change was not sudden and definite like that. But a change there was, nevertheless;
and, since one must be arbitrary, let us date it about the year 1910” (Woolf, 2).
Characterized by a deliberate split from traditional 19th century aesthetic, the focus of
Modernist literature shifted from an objective picture of mankind to a more subjective
view of the individual experiencing his or her unique world. Rather than art being
venerated as a reflection of external reality, an inversion took place at the time when the
Modernists wrote: art came to be viewed as a reflection of the individual’s perception of
his or her environment. Scholars and artists alike often cite the catalyst for this movement
as an amalgamation of developments in politics (the first World War, British
imperialism), technology (and thus in communication), psychology (in particular, Freud’s
psychoanalysis and the new emphasis on the subconscious as a source of motivation), and
wide-spread industrialization. These radical shifts caused generalized discomfort and
disappointment, which in turn led to a distrust of institutions. The world was growing
both bigger and smaller, and rather than focusing on the whole, artists began to focus on
the small individual within that whole: how does the individual fit within a larger social

58
structure? How do those who comprise the culture shape its consciousness, and how are
they in turn shaped by it?
This change in worldview gave birth to new artistic forms that were capable of
capturing and expressing the adjusting world – the “fractured surfaces of cubism, the
broken, syncopated rhythms of Schoenberg and Stravinsky, the montage method of the
movies” (Adams, 22), and of course the scrambled or nonexistent plots, the subjective
narration, the non-linear temporal progression, and the mundane subject matter of
Modernist literature. One of the goals of writing became “to represent complex synthetic
states of mind and the full multiplicity of our emotional subcurrents” (Adams, 28): it is
because of this intense attention to the development of the individual’s cognition within
the larger social context that I am drawn to Modernist novels to expand and compliment
my exploration of the maturation of childhood and adolescent self-concept. The
Modernists also focus on language -- its capacity and limitations -- and “Woolf’s
modernism is predicated upon the splitting of the word and unleashing of the power that
can be found within it” (Malamud, 33). The notion of a ‘steam of consciousness’ was
first introduced by William James in 1890 (in The Principles of Psychology), and the
popularization of this concept in novel form is, in my opinion, central to representation of
childhood consciousness, both in a factual and emotional sense. I also feel that there is a
distinctly human mark left upon Modernist work, as the artist’s effort to make sense of a
rapidly changing world is evident in his or her work. As T.S. Eliot said of Joyce’s
Modernist novels;
It is simply a way of controlling, of ordering, of giving shape and significance to
the immense panorama of futility and anarchy which is contemporary history. …

59
Psychology…ethnology, and The Golden Bough24 have concurred to make
possible what was impossible even a few years ago. Instead of narrative method,
we may now use the mythic method. It is, I seriously believe, a step toward
making the modern world possible for art.
Thus, there is tremendous value in synthesizing such a diverse range of
perspectives and tools. There are different ways to ‘know’ something, and knowledge can
be transferred in a variety of ways. We study to enrich our own everyday experiences,
and when we learn something truly of value it resonates with us and expands beyond the
moment in which we first encountered it. A successful piece of knowledge – whether it
comes in the form of a film or a mathematical proof – revolutionizes our world view and
causes us to examine all that we come in contact with afterwards in a different light.
While the visceral joy that comes with reading a perfectly balanced line of poetry is what
attracts us initially to written art, it is the recognition of our own experience in the
semantics of that phrase that sustains our love of the line. It is in the combination of these
two approaches that truly valuable ‘knowledge’ arises, adding depth and meaning to the
human experience. “A writer is never alone,” says Woolf, “there is always the public
with him” (Woolf, 10). We connect with art because of what we have experienced in the
past, and we are moved by a psychological study because of our awareness of its truth,
which we come to know through art and our every day lives. The two mutually ground
each other, working together to weave a richer, fuller relationship between the individual
and the world, and in this case between the reader and a full understanding of childhood
self-image and identity formation. Novels move us to tears because we can relate to the

24

Written by Scottish anthropologist Sir James George Frazer in 1890, The Golden
Bough: A Study in Magic and Religion was a comparative study of mythology and
religion, whose discussion of religion as a cultural phenomenon was characteristic of
Modernism.

60
human factor in them, the imagined author producing each word, the multifaceted
characters that we feel we know more intimately than our best friend. Psychology is able
to elicit those same miraculous emotions by analyzing that which we feel to be true and
moving it to the realm of what we know to be true. It is the real life implications and
applications of these two disciplines – art and science, literature and psychology- that
excite us, that make our lives better and more complex.
My Argument
According to creative writers and researchers alike, there is arguably a general
trajectory that identity formation follows, though within each larger route are thousands
of pathways each individual can take. In their novels, both Virginia Woolf and James
Joyce demonstrate a similar mode of developmental self-realization, with Woolf in
particular exploring the myriad ways this general outline for identity formation can be
explored and manifested in different individuals. In Woolf’s The Waves (1931) and
Joyce’s A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man (1916), the development of the
individual’s sense of identity is inseparable from the development of his or her
relationship to language. As young children we are nearly interchangeable, all separated
yet made similar by the wild experiences of childhood for which, at such a small age, we
have no words yet to adequately express what we think and feel. We then begin to use
our parent’s words - inherited language - being, as the character Neville says in The
Waves, merely “clinger[s] to the outsides of words” (W, 48). Namely, we are users of
language without the actual experiences with which to support and fully understand the
meaning of what we say. As we age we inevitably gain experience however, which in
turn imbues these previously ‘borrowed’ words with deeper meaning. Along with this

61
experience comes a recognition of ‘the other’, both as a group that previously defined us
as well as a group with the potential for being defined itself. We then more consciously
begin to form our identity, some choosing to establish ourselves in opposition to the other
and some wishing to join it, thereby extending some of the characteristics of the large
group to the individual. Whether we choose to define ourselves as part of the group or
against the group, we rely on peer evaluation in some form or another, either seeking
acceptance and group membership or desiring a recognition of our self-perceived
difference. In what follows, I will explore the trajectory of childhood identity formation,
drawing on canonical modernist texts as well as more recent psychological theories to
illustrate my argument.

Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs (1943)
Whether we choose to define ourselves with or against the other, we still need the
social support of our peers in order to instill the confidence that later allows us to become
fully formed individuals, capable of uniting the disparate parts of our opinions, feelings,
and experiences into a comprehensive and dynamic identity. We see this in the fiction of
Woolf and Joyce. But according to developmental psychologist Abraham Maslow, this
security is integral to a healthy self-concept, or, as Maslow re-defined it in his 1943
‘Hierarchy of Needs’, to one’s ‘self-actualization’; “what a man can be, he must be” (M,
382). In other words, self-actualization is “the desire to become more and more what one
is, to become everything that one is capable of becoming” (M, 382). This quest for one of
the final and most elusive pieces of identity formation is only possible, according to
Maslow, after a series of other, more basic needs are taken care of; Maslow identifies
these as physiological needs, safety, love and belonging, and esteem. Though Maslow

62
describes these stages of need and development as taking place over the individual’s
lifetime, for the purposes of this chapter I will be referring to his ‘hierarchy’
periodically25; I intend to introduce his theory in what follows, in order to secure it as an
overarching concept that informs my analysis of Woolf’s and Joyce’s characters.
For Maslow, the most basic motivators are ‘physiological’ needs, such as
breathing, food, water, sleep, shelter and other bodily functions. Without these most
simple requirements for human survival taken care of, the individual would literally cease
to exist, therefore rendering any subsequent emotional or intellectual needs irrelevant.
Once those base qualifications are met, next come ‘safety’ needs, such as the security of
body, employment, resources, family, health, and property. In the absence of these safety
needs – such as in the presence of war, economic or natural disaster, family violence, the individual can experience high levels of stress and other psychological disorders that
prevent the natural and healthy development of individuality. However, if both
physiological and safety needs are met, the third layer of human needs are social, defined
by Maslow as ‘love and belonging’. The individual “will hunger for affectionate relations
with people in general, namely, for a place in his group, and…he will want to attain such
a place more than anything else in the world” (M, 381). It is on this need that both Woolf
and Joyce focus, with Woolf in particular exploring the implications for this need for
‘love and belonging’ not being met. In Portrait, the main character Stephen Dedalus
simultaneously grapples with and takes comfort in the all-encompassing world of
theology and academia; while he never ceases to engage existential notions and reflect on
his place within the large group of masculine thinkers, it is his reliance on the feelings of

25

See Appendix M, Figure 1

63
group unity and social safety that ultimately allow him to move beyond the other needs
and reach the triumphant conclusion of the novel, to “encounter for the millionth time the
reality of experience and to forge in the smithy of [his] soul the uncreated conscience of
[his] race” (J, 275). In other words, without his formative social and academic
relationships, i.e. the fulfillment of his need for ‘love and belongingness’, he would have
been unable to reach self-actualization and become an independent thinker and artist.
Alternatively, Woolf explores the outcomes of both the fulfilled and unfulfilled
‘love and belongingness’ step, illustrating a variety of adult identities and life trajectories
that are formed in response to this need being (or not being) met. Most obviously and
most tragically is Rhoda, who when “alone, … fall[s] down into nothingness” (W, 44).
Despite having a similar upbringing to the other characters in the novel, Rhoda is
perpetually disconnected from her peers, occasionally because of her blatant rejection of
social advances, such as with Louis, or more often because of her crippling anxieties.
While her suicide is a culmination of many events, it is important to note that though
each character struggles with an aspect of social life, it is Rhoda, the epitome of the
outsider, “blown for ever outside the loop of time” (W, 22), who ends her own life.
Though she perhaps is responsible for ending or preventing any kind of intimacy
between herself and others- specifically in her interactions with Louis - it is true that
Rhoda does engage in a few brief relationships; therefore, if one were to argue that her
eventual demise was not due to a lack of love and belongingness, it is equally plausible
that Rhoda’s quest for self-actualization was abandoned at Maslow’s penultimate stage of
human needs: the need for ‘esteem’. Because Maslow’s hierarchy is intended to be
fulfilled (or not fulfilled) throughout the lifetime, the delicate difference between the love

64
and belongingness stage and the esteem stage is one of age -- at the love and
belongingness stage, the child has a sense that he or she is part of the group, and is given
a sense of comfort by a more anonymous feel of acceptance. Yet as the person ages, this
social support must come in the form of esteem, which is more individualized attention.
Rater than simply feeling like a welcome member of the group, he or she must feel
recognized and respected for specific qualities or achievements inherent to who he or she
is. “All people in our society,” Maslow writes, “…have a need or desire for a…high
evaluation of themselves…and for the esteem of others” (M, 381). He clarifies this stage
further, citing a ‘lower’ esteem need and a ‘higher’ one; the lower esteem is that of
others, the need to be respected and valued by peers and the desire for greater recognition
in the form of fame or prestige. The higher esteem is the need for self-respect, “the desire
for strength, for achievement, for adequacy, for confidence in the face of the world, and
for independence and freedom” (M, 381). Feelings of self-worth are listed as higher and
therefore more important, because they are conceivably more difficult to achieve and yet
are more essential than peer-esteem to the individual in becoming self-actualized. Though
Jinny thinks “Rhoda’s face mooning [is like] white petals,” Rhoda says she “hate[s]
looking-glasses which show [her her] real face” (W, 42). It does not matter if one is
adored by everyone if not also by oneself – self-esteem comes from experience and inner
determination. “Thwarting of these needs produces feelings of inferiority, of weakness,
and helplessness…. An appreciation of the necessity of basic self-confidence and an
understanding of how helpless people are without it, can be easily gained from a study of
severe traumatic neurosis,” Maslow reports (M, 382).

65
If all this hierarchy of needs are met, Maslow argues, the individual reaches ‘selfactualization’, the final stage of human need and identity development. Maslow’s model
is one of discontent that translates into motivation. Once all the individual’s basic needs
are taken care of - both physiologically and emotionally- Maslow argues, “a new
discontent and restlessness will soon develop, unless the individual is doing what he is
fitted for. A musician must make music, an artist must paint, a poet must write, if he is to
be ultimately happy” (M, 382) Namely, at this point in the one’s life, if all other more
basic wants are taken care of, one desires to “become more and more what one is, to
become everything that one is capable of becoming” (M, 382). Maslow stresses that the
manifestation of self-actualization varies greatly from person to person, and “in one
individual it may take the form of the desire to be an ideal mother,” like Woolf’s
character Susan, “in another it may be expressed athletically,” perhaps like Percival, “and
in still another it may be expressed in painting pictures or in inventions” (M, 383), as
exemplified by Bernard in Woolf and Stephen in Joyce.

“‘But here I am nobody. I have no face”:
Pre-Linguistic Interchangeability in The Waves
As adults, we define ourselves in comparison to others, forming relationships
based on shared characteristics and often taking pride in what makes us unique. As our
means of categorizing the world get increasingly complex – evolving from physical,
tangible modes of classification to more sophisticated and abstract concepts – so too do
our tools for self-definition; we go from bonding over our shirts of the same color to our
similar role as older sister, then on to our shared experience of first love and ultimately to
our corresponding political or spiritual views. The more advanced and abstracted our
means of self-organization and definition become, the more closely tied to language they

66
are, as the only manner we have to express thoughts and opinions which are not visible is
through language, written or spoken. Therefore in the beginning of our lives we appear
more or less interchangeable; for our first few years of life, we are so young that we have
not yet experienced much to set us apart from one another, and, even if singular
experiences do present themselves, our grasp on the language we would use to relate
these to one another is weak at best. Both Virginia Woolf and James Joyce are aware of
this distinct period, one of simultaneous interchangeability and disconnectedness. While
Joyce explores this theme from the inside out – namely, via one main character growing
up and attempting to classify the world around him – Woolf’s omniscient-style narration
of six interior monologues presents a unique view of objective subjectivity, allowing the
reader to directly observe the unfolding of individualism in multiple characters over time.
Woolf uses this technique to express the pre-linguistic consciousness of her characters,
and though they are not directly ‘speaking’ to one another she places each interior
monologue in quotation marks. In this way, she offers the reader unparalleled insight into
each character’s cognitive processes, abstractly representing their perceptions of their
surroundings.
In the opening pages of The Waves, Woolf draws on the characters’ direct
observations of their shared environment, each noticing a different – though still limited
to physical- aspect of their world; “‘I see a ring, said Bernard, hanging above me…’ ‘I
see a slab of pale yellow,’ said Susan… ‘I hear a sound,’ said Rhoda… ‘I see a globe,’
said Neville… ‘I see a crimson tassel,’ said Jinny… ‘I hear something stamping,’ said
Louis” (W, 9). Their ‘comments’ are all of readily observable phenomena, learned about
and understood via the senses: Bernard, Susan, Neville and Jinny explore their world

67
visually, and Rhoda and Louis rely on auditory cues. It is interesting to speculate about
the potential implications of Rhoda and Louis – the two outsiders of the novel – focusing
on their hearing rather than their sight. Perhaps at this early stage of development Woolf
is simply trying to demonstrate the various modes of interpretation of the environment
(sight, sound, taste, smell), or it is possible that she is setting up the trajectory of these
characters’ lives; vision is arguably more concrete, because dependence on sight also
requires that the perceiver to be within a close range of the object being seen. Hearing,
however, is more vague and thus allows for more freedom both of point of observation
(one can hear a train passing far away when one can not see it) as well as interpretation
(one can guess that the rumbling of that train is not in fact due to a train but rather to the
scrape of moving furniture upstairs, or the click of the furnace in the winter). Rhoda and
Louis spend their lives on the outskirts of sociability, Louis more intent on absorbing
language – through novels and poetry – than putting it forth. They are also the dreamers
of the group, and though Susan too is often lost in reverie, she is more nostalgic for a
concrete place (i.e. her childhood farm) rather than Rhoda’s continual existence in her
own head. “‘Their world is the real world,’” she says of Jinny and Susan, “‘the things
they lift are heavy. They say Yes, they say No; whereas I shift and change and am seen
through in a second.’” (W, 43).
Because of the varying sensory input as well as the lack of a greater context, upon
first glance these observations appear disparate; however, before the close of the first
page Woolf has masterfully begun to weave together the six voices, creating one
communal consciousness. Though the characters have moments throughout the rest of the
novel in which their internal monologues again overlap harmoniously, never again is

68
there the same degree of interchangeability of the speakers as found in the opening pages
of the novel. We hear the voices work together at various points later on, but this initial
symphony of perspectives is unique in that the characters have not yet established their
individual ways of thinking and speaking. It is only through retrospective analysis that we
are able to hypothesize that Rhoda and Louis’ initial dependence on hearing rather than
sight is deliberate and indicative of their character – with no knowledge of the rest of the
novel, all six voices blend together seamlessly and are indistinct from one another. As the
general framework of The Waves is one of development over time, these opening lines
represent the characters’ earliest childhood memories, at a point in their lives when they
are not yet obviously different from one another.
This interchangeability is due in part to a simple lack of experience – as children
they have not yet done enough to form distinct opinions and are still absorbing from their
environment. Because of their youth and participation in similar activities (i.e. learning
together at home and later at school), they are all amassed together: “‘here [at this age, in
school,] I am nobody,’” Rhoda mourns, “‘I have no face. This great company, all dressed
in brown serge, has robbed me of my identity. We are all callous, unfriended’” (W, 33).
Not only do they share the natural landscape of the opening scene, but they are further
bound by the effect this shared environment has on them: by the second round of
observations, i.e. by the time each character has spoken twice, their comments echo one
another without ever directly repeating phrases. Bernard mentions “‘beads of water’”,
and a few lines down Jinny describes “‘drops of water’” on another object, while Susan
and Neville describe “‘the leaves …gathered round the window’” and “‘the birds’ eyes
…bright in the tunnels between the leaves’” (W, 9). As the novel progresses and takes

69
shape, so too does each character’s unique world view. Once the characters are a bit
older, have had some basic experiences, and improve their grasp on language, it is much
more apparent which individual is speaking before reading the ‘he said’ ‘she said’. Yet,
in the formative opening pages it is extremely difficult to identify which character is
speaking solely by the content of their soliloquies.
Interchangeability and Philippe Rochat’s Levels of Self-Awareness
Woolf further explores both the impact of the environment on the children as well
as their early awareness of their place in that environment. While the first set of
observations are mutually exclusive and the second set begins to merge the characters,
the third exhibits a preliminary understanding of the effects their surroundings have on
them. This self-awareness in relation to the environment is supported by the literature in
developmental psychology as well; Philippe Rochat from Emory University suggests that
self-awareness in the first few years of life is easily categorized into six levels, which he
labels as “level 0” thru “level 5”. Though his definition of self-awareness is represented
through the child’s awareness of his or her own reflection in a mirror, the implications of
each level can be carried further and applied to daily life. “Level 0: Confusion [is the
level] at which the individual is oblivious of any mirror reflection, thus oblivious of the
mirror itself…[the mirror] is perceived as a mere extension of the environment, not a
reflection of it.” (R, 719) Rochat notes that birds that accidentally fly into windows are at
level 0 of self-awareness, but there are also “moments of absence when we, adult
humans, perceive and sometimes frighten ourselves for an instant when experiencing our
own mirror reflection as another person surreptitiously facing us” (R, 719). Level 1,
“differentiation”, “is the first sign that the individual is not oblivious of mirrors as

70
reflection…this level entails some basic perceptual differentiation” (R, 720). In other
words, Woolf’s opening page of observations could be categorized as Level 1
observations: the characters exhibit an early understanding of themselves as separate
from their environment, but there is not yet any reflection of their place in that
environment. If anything, the characters exist as disembodied aspects of a single
omniscient narrator, aware that they are separate from that which they are observing, yet
not entirely sure of their footing beyond that.
This second round of observations – in which Woolf examines that characters’
awareness of their place within the environment – is arguably the manifestation of
Rochat’s third step, “level 2: situation” (R, 720). In this level, the individual “explore[s]
how the experience of their own body relates to the specular [mirror] image…this can be
viewed as first signs of a contemplative stance toward the specular image” (R, 721), i.e.
the first time the individual is aware of his or herself as a body in control of movements
that are separate from but still related to his or her environment. “‘Stones are cold to my
feet,’ said Neville… ‘The back of my hand burns,’ said Jinny, ‘but the palm is clammy
and damp with dew’… ‘Birds are singing up and down and in and out all round us,’ said
Susan” (W, 10). Neville and Jinny focus on how their surroundings make their body feel,
while Susan notices where her physical self is in relation to her surroundings – the birds
are above her, below her, in front of her and behind her. Rather than simply observing
what they see or hear, the children now begin to place themselves in relation to their
surroundings, demonstrating self-awareness, albeit in a limited form. They start to catalog
cause and effect, noticing how their physical bodies – the most reliable way they have of
knowing themselves – react to the various stimuli around them. These reactions and

71
realizations can be pleasant, such as when Joyce’s protagonist Stephen realizes “his
mother had a nicer smell than his father” (J, 3) or confusing, such as “when you wet the
bed first it is warm then it gets cold” (J, 3). Yet with each observation, positive or
negative, their new world is slowly illuminated.

“We are in a hostile country”(w,17) :
The Environment of Childhood as a Fragile Space
Susceptibility and Uncertainty: The Physical Environment in The Waves
The characters in The Waves as well as Portrait understand their environment
through direct engagement, but where the two authors differ slightly is in their own
subjective conception of what the environment of childhood is like. For Joyce, childhood
can be confusing and isolating, but these negative aspects do not seem to overpower the
overall experience of youth. Woolf, however, conceives of childhood as a much more
delicate, dangerous place, in which ignorance is not bliss and inexperience is not
necessarily cause for excitement. Her representation of childhood is a place of
helplessness, uncertainty, and simultaneous dependence and isolation. While the six
children of The Waves explicitly comment on the appearance of their environment
through what they say, their constant fear and fragility are implicit in how they say it.
Rhoda, the figure most often alone, observes the birds, not long after Susan first notices
them “‘singing up and down and in and out all round’” (W, 10). “‘The birds sang in
chorus first,’ said Rhoda. ‘Now the scullery door is unbarred. Off they fly. Off they fly
like a fling of seed. But one sings by the bedroom window alone’” (W, 10). Indicative of
their core differences, Susan comments on her connectedness to the birds, while Rhoda
focuses on their union and subsequent dispersion. Though most of the flock flies off, one
is left behind, either of its own volition or unintentionally. As it is evident in the

72
childhood experience as well, “fear was in [the birds’] song, and apprehension of pain,
and joy to be snatched quickly now at this instant” (W, 73). This structure of fluctuating
cohesion and dissipation is mimicked innumerable times throughout the rest of the novel;
on the following page, Louis notes, “‘Now they have all gone…I am alone. They have
gone into the house for breakfast, and I am left standing by the wall among the flowers’”
(W, 11). Later Rhoda is playing with flower petals in a puddle, pretending that they are
ships: “‘some will founder. Some will dash themselves against the cliffs. One sails alone.
That is my ship’” (W, 19).
Woolf integrates the children and their environment, continually planting parallel
patterns of movement in the natural and social world. The omniscient narrator in the
beachfront scene describes “the dew dancing on the tips of the flowers and leaves [that]
made the garden like a mosaic of single sparks not yet formed into one whole” (W, 29);
the characters are comparable to these disconnected dewdrops, joined together by their
shared environment but inevitably separated by youth, experience, and human nature. At
this young age, Woolf stresses the influence of the environment on the child, much like
that of an unprotected and helpless plant or animal: “‘I hold a stalk in my hand’” says
Louis. “‘I am the stalk. My roots go down to the depths of the world... I am all fibre. All
tremors shake me, and the weight of the earth is pressed to my ribs’” (W, 12). Even as
adults we are influenced by our environment, both natural and social, but it is the unique
space of childhood – a space before individualism, language or experience – that allows
for such a dramatic degree of susceptibility. With no tools to carve their own way, Woolf
views children often as victims to their surroundings, left to wander with knowledge of
loneliness and none of how to cure it. “It is difficult not to weep as we sing,” Louis says,

73
“as we pray that God may keep us safe while we sleep, calling ourselves little children.
When we are sad and trembling with apprehension it is sweet to sing together, leaning
slightly, I towards Susan, Susan towards Bernard, clasping hands, afraid of much, I of my
accent, Rhoda of figures; yet resolute to conquer” (W, 26).
Inclusion and Exclusion: The Social Environment in The Waves
Unfortunately, this acknowledgement of fear and “apprehension” does not equal
an understanding of a possible solution - as awareness of the self increases, so does
awareness of the other, and therefore the child is now not only afraid of the natural
environment but the social environment as well. Rochat defines the 3rd level of selfawareness as “‘identification’…[the level at which] the individual manifests recognition,
the fact that what is in the mirror is ‘Me,’ not another individual starting and showing the
self” (R, 721) Level 4 then, is “the self identified beyond the here and now … the
identification of the self is not tied to the temporal simultaneity and spatial coincidence of
the body and its reflection” (R, 722). This sense of a permanent self is necessary for the
individual to experience many emotions, and it is arguably at this stage that Woolf’s
characters begin to observe and unfortunately fear their environment; to refer back to
Maslow, the children are still stuck on fulfilling the second level of needs, “safety”. Once
this is achieved however, Woolf’s and Joyce’s characters begin to have a more social
orientation, as supported by Maslow and Rochat. Maslow’s third level is “love and
belongingness”, and in Rochat’s sixth level, “Level 5: self--consciousness or ‘meta’ self-awareness… the self is now recognized not only from a first person perspective, but also
from a third person’s. Individuals are not only aware of what they are but how they are in
the mind of others” (R, 722). Once the individual has a basic understanding of ‘self’-- as

74
basic as the self as different from the other and the self as existing throughout time-- that
individual’s focus then naturally turns from outward (what is the world?) to inward (what
am I?) orientation, and then to a nuanced blending of both (who am I in this world?).
Applying this progression to Woolf’s understanding of fear as the dominant emotion of
childhood, once the child develops a sense of self and then a sense of the other, the next
natural fear is that of the social world.
“‘Jinny and Susan, Bernard and Neville bind themselves into a thong with which
to lash me.’” Louis insists. “‘They laugh at my neatness, at my Australian accent’” (W,
20), in other words, they exclude him for all the ways in which he is different, and the
emotional pain of rejection is so acute that it is described in physical terms. Because of an
insufficient grasp on language, there is an inherent isolation to early childhood
experiences – if one cannot express one’s emotions, one feels alone. However once one
develops a more sophisticated understanding of ‘the self’ and ‘the other’, one realizes that
‘the self’ is an entity that can be judged by ‘the other’ – you can evaluate them, but they
can just as easily evaluate you. Thus this isolation deepens, as the desire to communicate
with one’s peers is motivated not only by an attempt to alleviate the pain of aloneness,
but also to have some volition and control over how one is viewed by others. Now,
confusion at the natural world provides fodder for discomfort and anxiety, as does the
fear of ostracism. Neville “‘ha[s] no power of ingratiating [him]self’” (W, 70) and thus
no control over how his ‘self’-- the object of scrutiny for others, just as others are the
object of scrutiny for him -- is seen.
With the development of this new, more acute sense of the relationship of ‘self’
and ‘other’, the individual does not necessarily have to be the obvious subject of

75
exclusion – the desire for inclusion and approval is so great that even the sense of the
individual that he or she is out of step with the others is cause for pain. Rhoda reports:
“‘the others look; they look with understanding. Louis writes, Susan writes; Neville
writes; Jinny writes; even Bernard has begun to write. But I cannot write…. I am left
alone to find an answer…I begin to draw a figure and the world is looped in it, and I
myself am outside the loop; which I now join - so - and seal up, and make entire. The
world is entire, and I am outside of it, crying, ‘Oh, save me, from being blown for ever
outside the loop of time!’” Though there is no explicit exclusion, in this case the feeling
of being “outside the loop” is extremely overwhelming.
Inclusion and Exclusion: The Social Environment in A Portrait of the Artist as a
Young Man
Stephen experiences a similar phenomenon for the first time at school, as he tries
to navigate the social world through the ever-shifting and treacherous footing of jokes,
humor and word-play; when the older boys ask if he kisses his mother, he answers ‘yes’,
and then ‘no’, aware that he is missing some key social exchange but unable to discover
which it is. “They all laughed again. Stephen tried to laugh with them. He felt his whole
body hot and confused in a moment. What was the right answer to the question? He had
given two and still Wells laughed. But Wells must know the right answer for he was in
the third of grammar” (J, 11). Like Rhoda, Stephen is aware that he is ‘outside the loop’,
but his understanding of the social world is not yet developed enough for him to
deliberately pinpoint the source of his discomfort. Rather than try to parse out the
nuanced relationship between himself and ‘the others’ – Wells and the older boys –
Stephen instead focuses on that which he is more familiar with: the actual words used.

76
“He still tried to think what was the right answer. Was it right to kiss his mother or wrong
to kiss his mother? What did that mean, to kiss?” (J, 11)

“Above all, we have inherited tradition”:
Inherited Thought Structures and Inherited Language
Here, Stephen exhibits what is arguably the next step in identity formation –
beginning to examine the language we use as young children, in order to transcend our
status as “clinger[s] to the outsides of words” (W, 48). When we are young, we learn
through observation and imitation, copying the actions we see and the words we hear. As
we are susceptible to our environment, we become familiar with the words surrounding
us, thus ‘adopting’ them without fully questioning their meaning. Even as Stephen is
aware that he is somehow making a mistake, he is certain that there is a ‘right’ answer to
this taunting question, and he further assumes that “Wells must know the right answer for
he was in the third of grammar” (J, 11). Because Wells is older, he is a role model to
whom Stephen looks in order to learn what is ‘right’ and what is ‘wrong’; children learn
through imitation, and Stephen strives to copy Wells’ belief system, exploring his own
world through the pre-constructed schema of someone older and more experienced.
Before we gain direct experience, we espouse the views of those around us and ‘try on’
their outlook on life. We form ourselves in relation to these structures, embracing them as
our own beliefs until we grow older and learn about life for ourselves. As Louis looks
back on his time in school, he thinks, “‘above all, we have inherited traditions’” (W, 58).
Though he has learned countless facts, the most salient impression strict academia has
left is the passing on of tradition, both in the sense of repeated customs (patterns of
action) as well as beliefs (patterns of thought).

77
The use of the word “inherited” is essential to understanding/ the nuanced point as
well – it is a relatively passive word, all about ‘coming into possession’ or ‘receiving’
something that is given to you. There is no agency in inheritance, rather it is bestowed
upon you by someone older, and therefore assumedly wiser. At the end of our parents’
lives we inherit their physical possessions, but at the beginning of their lives as parents
we inherit their intangible ones, i.e. their weltanschauung, or worldview. We not only
allow our parents to speak for us, but assume they will. In fact, the first time Stephen is
identified to the reader by name it is by his mother: “He hid under the table. His mother
said: - O, Stephen will apologise” (J, 4). She calls him by his name and therefore
solidifies his identity as a separate if not yet autonomous being. In addition, she makes
known her assumption of his current emotions - presumably one of regret, if he is on the
precipice of an apology- as well as shaping his next action – he will apologize.
Interestingly, the first time Stephen is identified by ‘the other’ and thus thrust into the
circle of public scrutiny, it is under the condition of a concession – namely, ‘this is
Stephen and you will know him as someone who is doing something wrong that warrants
an apology’. In the reader’s preliminary stages of knowing Stephen, we adopt his
mother’s view of him, just as Stephen himself does. Before he is able to think selfreflexively, Stephen relies on his parents’ opinions of him and their surroundings. At
Christmas dinner, Stephen’s father’s “face was glowing with anger, and Stephen felt the
glow rise to his own cheek” (J, 38) though he was not part of the argument directly.
Stephen’s understanding of his social and physical surroundings are filtered through his
parents and other respected adults, and in lieu of his own direct experience – i.e. laughing

78
at something because it is truly funny - he models his feelings on their emotional cues –
i.e. laughing at something because his father is chuckling at it.
Similarly, the opening chapters of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man are
riddled with phrases repeated from Stephen’s mother and father: “that was not a nice
expression. His mother had told him not to speak with the rough boys in college” (J, 5),
and “his father had told him, whatever he did, never to peach on a fellow” (J, 19).
Children absorb the weltanschauung of their elders, as well as the language they express
those worldviews in. As their possession of language strengthens and grows, children
begin to collect and categorize passed-down phrases, whether that means avoiding
expressions that your mother tells you are ‘not nice’, or calling yourself a good older
brother because your uncle constantly tells you that you are kind to your siblings. As the
individual matures, so too does his weltanschauung, and he can therefore decide for
himself which expressions are ‘not nice’ and whether or not his relationship to his
younger brother is central to his character.

“Clinger[s] to the outsides of words”:
Words as symbols of Experience
However, it is from before the developmental sophistication of designing one’s
own weltanschauung that Woolf’s Neville mourns his dilemma - the child as the
“‘clinger to the outsides of words’” (W, 48). Past the phase of interchangeability and into
the phase of early identity formation, the child gathers and repeats frequently heard
phrases without necessarily knowing what they mean, without having the true life
experience to back up the empty linguistic inheritance. Rhoda is someone riddled with
anxiety that prevents her from immersing herself in life experience, and she grieves that
others “‘know what to say if spoken to. They laugh really; they get angry really; while

79
[she has] to look first and do what other people do when they have done it’” (W, 43). In
other words, there seem to have the experience to fill in their previously hollow words,
while she, Neville, and the other children are still collectors, hovering around the sounds
of the words without understanding their true meaning.
The opposite is Woolf’s Percival, “‘Percival who inspires poetry’” (W, 40),
Percival who, in his unique mode of interacting with the world on a purely physical,
sensory, and immediate level, has transcended the role of “clinger” and seems to pierce
straight to the message the symbol of the word represents. “‘For he cannot read,’” Neville
says,
Yet when I read Shakespeare or Catullus, lying in the long grass, he understands more
than Louis. Not the words – but what are the words? Do I not know already how to
rhyme, how to imitate Pope, Dryden, even Shakespeare? But I cannot stand all day in
the sun with my eyes on the ball; I cannot feel the flight of the ball through my body
and think only of the ball. I shall be a clinger to the outsides of words all my life. (W,
48)
Neville understands that until he is able to live in the moment, and exist as a corporeal
being in a space without words, he will never be able to understand what is being
‘signified’ by the ‘signifier’ of the word. One may think one has experienced great
sadness and freely use words like ‘grieve’, ‘lament’, and ‘mourn’, but until one has had
the misfortune of the death of a loved one or a missed opportunity, the words remain
mere guesses, attempts at containing the vast and complex emotion of devastation.
Though Neville has learned about the great writers of the time, he has yet to learn what
they are writing about, and this knowledge can only come through direct experience.
Percival is on the opposing side of the spectrum, existing in the novel as the symbol for
all things corporeal, experiential, and present. He is the epitome of youth, dying before he
can grow old and occupying a space deeper than language, in the core of the meaning of

80
words. “‘But now he is young,’” says Neville. “‘Not a thread, not a sheet of paper lies
between him and the sun, between him and the rain, between him and the moon as he lies
naked, tumbled, hot, on his bed’” (W, 48). Namely, there are no words separating him
and direct experience. Neville, Bernard, and the others are caught up in learning words
before they are able to ‘learn’ the experience, while Percival concerns himself solely
with direct impressions. He is also one of the central characters, though he is the only one
without a reader-accessible interior monologue, further emphasizing his inhabitance of
immediate, physical experience rather than cerebral analysis. Because of this, however,
he is more at the mercy of peer evaluation than the other characters, who are able to have
some agency in self-representation through the accessibility of their soliloquies to the
reader. This further emphasizes the importance of language in erecting a self-image, a
value that the children are aware of yet not capable of doing.
Percival’s approach is not the developmental norm; rather, it is more common to
first collect the words and later delve into their deeper meaning. This, however, does not
mean that one cannot begin to question language: these preliminary questions are
essential to laying the foundation upon which subsequent experience can build. After the
older boys tease Stephen, he asks himself, “What did that mean, to kiss? You put your
face up like that to say goodnight and then his mother put her face down. That was to
kiss. His mother put her lips on his check; her lips were soft and they wetted his cheek;
and they made a tiny little noise: kiss. Why did people do that with their two faces?” (J,
11) It is not until Stephen has the experience of being teased that he backtracks and
reflects on the experience of kissing, realizing that there is something inherent in the act
that can be cause for ridicule. He questions what it means, beginning with the literal –

81
“you put your face up…. and then his mother put her face down” – moving on to how it
feels – “her lips were soft…and they made a tiny little noise” – and finally settling on an
examination of the motivation for the act – “why did people do that with their two
faces?” He understands the act of kissing just as he understands the act of speaking – he
is capable of completing both as actions, yet he doesn’t entirely understand the
motivation for or meaning of a kiss, just as he is unaware of the true meaning of most of
the language he is using. Because he is still inarticulate and aware of words with multiple
meanings, he is particularly vulnerable; he may know that kisses are a way to show
affection, just as he knows that words are a way to show thoughts and emotion, but until
he matures and experiences love in a more profound manner, the ‘true’ meaning of a kiss
is inaccessible to him.
Understanding Language Through Physical Experiences
Until Stephen does and feels certain things, his words will be vacant, not yet
strengthened by experience. Direct knowledge does not just come in the form of
sophisticated emotions like ‘love’ or ‘grief’, but instead begins the moment one is born.
Before language and other emotional complexities develop, we discover things through
our body; therefore noting our physical sensations is the earliest and most basic way to
experience things and subsequently give weight to our words. Corporeality as the most
basic filter of experience in turn influences our early understanding of the entire world; if
we first learn things through our body – i.e. I am cold, I am warm – our first connections
are based on these initial experiences – i.e. I am cold in the shade, I am warm in the sun.
These simple and concrete cause-and-effect relationships shape the way we form our
world schema – i.e. I am cold in the shade thus other people are cold in the shade- and we

82
therefore don’t like and are unable to fully understand situations that go against or blend
these strict schema – i.e. I am cold in the shade but she was just running around and so
she is sweaty and therefore not cold in the shade. Understanding nuance in life requires a
certain level of cognitive sophistication that is unavailable at such a young age, and thus
we, as young, corporeal beings, begin to construct preliminary worldviews based on
physical sensation. As noted earlier, the children’s initial observations in the opening
pages of The Waves are all physical, and even the characters become more distinct they
continue to filter their experiences through their bodies. First there are observations, such
as when Woolf’s Jinny notes, “‘I burn, I shiver … out of this sun, into this shadow’” (W,
11) and soon on to more complex bodily narrations and observations:
I must throw myself on the ground and pant. I am out of breath with running, with
triumph. Everything in my body seems thinned out with running and triumph. My
blood must be bright red, whipped up, slapping against my ribs. My soles tingle,
as if wire rings opened and shut in my feet. I see every blade of grass very clear.
But the pulse drums so in my forehead, behind my eyes, that everything
dances…there is nothing staid, nothing settled in this universe. All is rippling, all
is dancing; all is quickness and triumph. (W, 46)
This victorious declaration begins with physical sensation - because it is the children’s
primary mode of interaction with their world –and it soon progresses from purely
physical observations, to reflections on these physical observations, to preliminary world
schema. In this case with Jinny, her excitement at her harmony with her physical body
gives birth to the notion that “‘all is rippling, all is dancing; all is quickness and
triumph.’” While this literally means that her heart rate is so rapid that her head is
pounding and her vision shaking, it metaphorically represents her general outlook on life,
one dominated by optimism, physicality, success and slight competition.

83
Alternatively, other characters’ more incongruous relationship with their physical
bodies leads to an equally discordant relationship with their surroundings. Not
surprisingly, in The Waves it is largely Rhoda and Louis – the nebulous, pensive outsiders
– who have the most difficulty connecting to their bodies, and thus are the two who also
have the most trouble with direct experiences that lead to concrete world schema. “‘But
when darkness comes I put off this unenviable body,’” says Louis, “‘my large nose, my
thin lips, my colonial accent, and inhabit space’” (W, 52). Rhoda as well “ hate[s] the
looking-glass which show[s her her] real face’” (W, 44). Because of these initial
insecurities and perhaps an inborn, more introverted orientation, there is a painful but
unmistakable separation of mind and body, and they seem to regard their bodies as
hindrances rather than valuable lenses through which to experience the world. Rhoda
daydreams and must “‘return […] very painfully, drawing [her]self back into [her]
body’” (W, 64), while Louis says, “‘my body passes vagrant as a bird’s shadow. I should
be transient as the shadow on the meadow, soon fading, soon darkening and dying there
where it meets the wood, were it not that I coerce my brain to form in my forehead’” (W,
66). Because Rhoda and Louis are both uneasy with their corporeality they reject it,
forming a separate mental and spiritual life away from their physicality. While this may
provide moment-to-moment relief, the two characters sacrifice an essential learning tool
– the body -- that is integral to world understanding and identity formation.
Forming Schema Through Physical Experience: The Visual Cliff Experiment and
Maternal Facial Signaling
Understanding of bodily sensation and straightforward cause-and-effect
relationships enhances early reflection of events, both big and small. The most simple
and often used example is that of the child touching the stove and getting burned.

84
Because of the resulting physical discomfort, the child knows not to touch the stove
again, or the stove in another person’s house, or objects that give off heat or glow red. By
reading their environment, children not only avoid bodily harm but potentially emotional
harm as well. In 1960, Dr. Gibson and Dr. Walk investigated infant depth perception,
conducting an experiment entitled the “visual cliff”. The visual cliff was made of a long,
thick piece of Plexiglas, placed over a brightly checkered blanket that begins directly
beneath the Plexiglas and soon drops a few feet, creating the perspective of a steep drop
beneath the safety of the sturdy Plexiglas plank. Gibson and Walk then placed 36 infants,
aged 6-8 months, on the shallow side of a visual cliff apparatus, and the infant’s mother
on the other side of the plank, i.e. at the end of the “deep” side26. 27 of the infants
crawled over to their mother happily. Though a few were hesitant and a few more refused
to cross the apparent drop, most of the infants relied on the solid feel of the glass and
their mother’s encouraging face to convince them to move across – in other words, they
relied on previous experience (crawling on something solid, referring to their mother to
gauge the safety of a situation) to help them in their current situation.
Interested in the notion of maternal signaling, James F. Sorce and his colleagues
tested to see if mothers with varying facial expressions would affect a baby’s choice to
proceed across the visual cliff. As hypothesized, when mothers had joyful, encouraging,
interested expressions their child was more likely to cross towards them than if they
showed fear or anger. Interestingly, in the absence of a perceived drop children did not
often reference their mother’s face, suggesting that parental emotional signaling is most
influential in times of uncertainty. Both experiments - the original visual cliff study as

26

See Appendix M, Figure 2

85
well as the impact of maternal facial expression - support Joyce and Woolf’s notion of
corporeal experience as the basis of ensuing world understanding. Though new to
crawling, the infants know from previous experience that solid things will support their
weight. They also know that if they are unsure as to how to proceed – as they often are,
due to lack of experience – they can rely on their mother to directly or indirectly tell them
what to do, assuming the parent-child relationship is a typical, healthy, and nurturing one.
Jinny understands her world by running through it, touching everything along the way.
As she wakes up, she describes reflects: “‘as each thing in my bedroom grows clear, my
heart beats quicker. I feel my body harden, and become pink, yellow, brown. My hands
pass over my legs and body. I feel its slopes, its thinness’” (W, 55). The way she begins
each day – by seeing, by touching, and by paying attention to her physical reactions – is
symbolic of how she and many other children begin their life. In addition, the relationship
between Joyce’s Stephen and his parents perfectly exemplifies the influential maternal
emotional signaling in the Sorce et al. study; in any doubtful situation, Stephen looks to
his mother and father for cues, laughing at what they deem funny, shunning what they
deem inappropriate, and reacting with a “terrorstricken face [when he] saw that his
father’s eyes were full of tears” (J, 39). Just as the infants in the experiments relied on a
combination of parental assurance – i.e. borrowed schema – and physical confirmation –
i.e. personal, corporeal experience -- so too do the characters in The Waves and A Portrait
of the Artist as a Young Man.

“I require the concrete in everything”:
Strict Schema Formation
Stephen’s early exploration of himself in relation to his environment – albeit a
strictly somatic one – is one of the ways in which he and other children systematize their

86
environment. They use an embodied mode of experience to establish cause and effect
relationships, which they then combine together to form larger and more complex
schema. Because of this, the child’s world is one of black and white, right and wrong, and
children often repeat words and actions simply because they are ‘right’; they don’t have
the sophistication of reflection or life experience to decide for themselves if something is
subjectively ‘right’ or ‘wrong’ – in their eyes things have an objective ‘trueness’ or
‘falseness’, one or the other. Every night, Stephen “had to undress and then kneel and say
his own prayers and be in bed before the gas was lowered so that he might not go to hell
when he died” (J, 16). Though Stephen continues to pray for quite awhile as he ages, he
later does so because he genuinely believes in the religious way of life. At this early
stage, however, he has learned from others that if one prays, one does not go to hell, and
if one does not pray, one does go to hell. Early thinking of one’s world and one’s identity
is very linear, and believing in these initial right and wrong, black and white situations
with clear distinctions allows for the child to process the world. Later, when he or she is
older, the child is able to readjust his or her schema and reexamine certain aspects of the
world.
There is an almost frantic insistence that these concrete rules must be adhered to,
and often it is more painful for expectations to be violated than it is to establish a
negative cause and effect relationship initially. For example, when Stephen “felt the
touch of the prefect’s fingers as they had steadied his hand and at first he had thought he
was going to shake hands with him because the fingers were soft and firm: but then in an
instant he had heard the swish of the soutane sleeve and the crash” (J, 53). It is painful to
be struck, but it is traumatizing to be struck after expecting a handshake first – it is the

87
violence of the transgression rather than the violence itself that is cause for such anguish.
When Stephen and the other boys discuss the older students who could choose to be
expelled or flogged as punishment for a crime they committed, they are sympathetic
towards their peers but not horrified at the notion of a beating; this is not only because “a
flogging wears off after a bit but a fellow that has been expelled from college is known
all his life on account of it” (J, 44), but also because the boys were given an option and
know what to expect from the beginning. When a child is not yet confident in his way of
systemizing his universe, it is imperative that the painstakingly constructed cause and
effect relationships are not proven false.
The Violation of Expectation Theory and Fear of the ‘Unclassifiable’ Rather than
the ‘Novel’
Similarly, in the developmental psychology literature, the “Violation of
Expectation” or ‘VOE’ task tests “whether children look reliably longer when
[experimenters] act in a manner that is inconsistent, as opposed to consistent,” (Scott et
al., 2011) with what the child is expecting to happen, depending on the paradigm
established in the particular experiment. In nearly all the studies in which the VOE has
been employed (i.e. Onishi & Baillargeon, 2005, Surian, Caldi & Sperber, 2007),
researchers have found that young participants “look longer at unexpected events,
whether or not the events were real or pretend” (Tee & Dissanayake, 2011). They
concluded that the infants tested might look longer at unexpected events “due to
violations of expectations they have about familiar action sequences.” Just like these
participants, Joyce’s Stephen, Woolf’s Louis, and Susan, and all the other characters of
The Waves are often more troubled by the interruption of their meticulously crafted
schema than they are by the introduction of new events that require the construction of

88
new schema all together. Therefore there is a an almost panicky necessity on the part of
the characters to deal with the world only in terms of black and white, right and wrong –
as Neville says, “I hate dangling things; I hate dampish things. I hate wandering and
mixing things together” (W, 19). Dangling things are both attached at a base but free
enough to move, while dampness is caught between dry and wet. There is fear in the
unclassifiable rather than the novel: Stephen seems more unnerved by “Father Dolan’s
whitegrey not young face, his baldy white-grey head with fluff at the sides of it, the steel
rims of his spectacles and his nocolored eyes looking through the glasses” (J, 51) than if
he is definitively monstrous looking. Father Dolan doesn’t look ‘old’ but rather ‘not
young’, his head is not entirely bald nor entirely hairy, and his eyes are not categorically
‘blue’ or ‘brown’ but rather ‘nocolored’. Because Father Dolan and other ambiguous
things in the world defy clear classification, children are not sure how to filter them, and
when they are confronted with something that doesn’t fit in to their laboriously drafted
schema, it produces anxiety and fear.
Even in circumstances of ambiguity - such as ‘nocolored’ or damp – children
actively try to create rules to govern their world. Stephen “wondered whether the
scullion’s apron was damp too or whether all white things were cold and damp” (J, 9),
discovering a particular truth – i.e. that the apron was damp – and hypothesizing that it
perhaps applies to all similar things – i.e. that all white things might be cold and damp
too. “‘I require the concrete in everything’” (W, 68) Woolf’s Bernard explicitly states,
and when he is unable to find that concreteness he relies on his imagination to fill in what
he does not know, therefore creating the solidity that he ‘requires’ in his life. By telling
stories about his surrounding and narrating his life, he “‘run[s] together whatever happens

89
so that instead of incoherence there is perceived a wandering thread, lightly joining one
thing to another’” (W, 49). In this way he is always able to make sense of his
surroundings, imagining them as part of a larger whole. Comparably, Neville takes
comfort in grammar, noting that “‘each tense…means differently. There is an order in
this world; there are distinctions, there are differences in this world, upon whose verge I
step’” (W, 21).
For a young person constantly assaulted with new experiences, there is solace in
adhering to certain rules, which make the disorganized world less chaotic. This mode of
world interaction often leads to thinking about less tangible concepts in a more physical
and concrete way too: for example, there is a notion that identity is physically dependent,
and Stephen wonders “what Father Arnall and Paddy Barrett [and] Mr. McGlade and Mr.
Gleeson would have become if they had not become Jesuits. It was hard to think what
because you would have to think of them in a different way with different coloured coats
and trousers and with beards and moustaches and different kinds of hats” (J, 49). Because
Stephen and the other children are in the midst of early schema-creation, it is very trying
for them to separate a person’s social role or definition from his physical one. Likewise,
once a person’s social role is established, even if it has been successfully distanced from
their appearance, it is arduous for a young child to conceptualize that person’s role in any
sort of fluid way. Though what someone is supposed to do is not as visible as how they’re
supposed to look, social obligations and definitions are still approached in a stern ‘black’
vs. ‘white’ manner: “Was that a sin for Father Arnall to be in a wax or was he allowed to
get into a wax when the boys were idle because that made them study better […]?”
Stephen wonders. He reasons “It was [allowed] because [he was a priest and] a priest

90
would know what a sin was and would not do it” (W, 48). Before a more nuanced
understanding of the world develops – i.e. an awareness that things are not always clearcut and people do not always act as they are supposed to – Stephen assumes that people
function in the same linear cause and effect manner that many objects do. Because priests
do not commit sins and Father Arnall is a priest, that means that Father Arnall does not
commit sins, so if he gets angry it must not be a sin. The fact that this analysis is not
centered on a physical object but rather is reflecting on intangible activity is a sign of
cognitive maturation, yet Stephen’s simplistic understanding of the static nature of ‘sin’
and ‘priesthood’ is still indicative of a young mind.

The Corporeal – Linguistic Relationship:
Abstract Events as Filtered Through Initially Established Physical Schema
Children copy language and follow parental signals, slowly integrating these carefully
gathered phrases and attitudes with their own concrete, bodily experiences. As exposure
to corporeal sensations increase, however, the individual begins to categorize and process
the rest of his world through similar modes. In other words, as the individual starts to
experience more intricate mental and emotional experiences in addition to events related
to embodiment, those emotional events are filtered through this initially established
physical schema. For example, as Stephen feels homesick for the first time he is aware
that he is emotionally upset, but he is so accustomed to dealing with physical sickness
that he is delayed in pinpointing the origin of his discomfort. A peer tells him he must be
“sick in [his] breadbasket…but he was not sick there. He thought that he was sick in his
heart if you could be sick in that place” (J, 10). Stephen’s early analysis of ‘heart
sickness’ is an example of his slow but steady categorization of his world. He is not quite
developed enough to discuss his emotions in an abstract sense, since his only tools for

91
organizing his environment are what he physically experiences; he knows what it feels
like to have a stomach illness, and because his homesickness is acting in a similar way
upon his body and mind, the easiest way for him to process what is going on is to put it
into terms he knows. Likewise, he begins to analyze his existential position in the world
by first tackling it in a physical and organizational sense:
Stephen Dedalus
Class of elements
Clongowes Wood College
Sallins
County Kildare
Ireland
Europe
The world
The universe (J, 12)
Stephen sits in class, placing himself in context with the rest of his world. As we age we
are able to reflect on our life position more abstractly, highlighting the importance of our
social roles or interests in order to orient ourselves in relation to the rest of our world.
Still existing in the realm of borrowed language and corporeal experience, Stephen
undertakes this immensely philosophical task in a concrete, physical way. He is in his
classroom, in his school, in his town, county, country, continent, planet, universe. If he
were to write up a similar context ‘map’ later, it would most likely be less literal and
physical and more conceptual and social.
Children’s early construction of schema is moderated through their understanding
of their own somatic experience, and therefore they are habituated to filtering the
environment through their corporeality. It logically follows then that their early
impressions of language use are also mediated by embodiment, and both Woolf and
Joyce spend time exploring the interaction of physicality and linguistic understanding. In

92
A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, Stephen muses: “Suck was a queer word, but the
sound was ugly. Once he had washed his hands in the lavatory of the Wicklow Hotel and
his father pulled the stopper up by the chain after and the dirty water went down through
the hole in the basin. And when it had all gone down slowly the hole in the basin had
made a sound like that: suck. Only louder” (J, 8). Stephen compares his experience of
speaking the onomatopoeic word to his first memory of hearing the source of the sound,
and then he reflects on how the word and the sound feel in his mouth as he speaks them.
As with literary characters and all real-life individuals, Stephen is an embodied being
whose subjective memories of sensory input influence the way he interacts with
language. Remembering the way the water basin sounded and felt illuminates a series of
associations when Stephen hears the word ‘suck’ used in a different context. He considers
the word “wine” in the same way: “the word was beautiful: wine. It made you think of
dark purple because the grapes were dark purple that grew in Greece outside houses like
white temples” (J, 47). Stephen’s singular sensual experiences of sound, sight, taste and
touch affects the way he absorbs and uses language.
The corporeal-linguistic relationship is reciprocal as well, and as beings who are
susceptible to sensory input we not only influence words but are also influenced by them.
Upon hearing a poem, Stephen remarks, “How beautiful and sad it was! How beautiful
the words were where they said Bury me in the old churchyard! A tremor passed over his
body. How sad and how beautiful! He wanted to cry quietly but not for himself: for the
words, so beautiful and sad, like music” (J, 22). This reaction is perhaps due in part to
the melodic quality of poetic language – Stephen initially heard the lyrics set to music,
though in this context he is simply repeating them back to himself in the form of poetry.

93
There is also a pleasant rhyme scheme to the lines, creating almost a lilting, lullaby-like
feeling. However, Stephen does not seem to be rocked purely by the sounds of the letters,
but more likely by the delicate sentiment which they express. Neville shares this reaction,
noting that he “love[s] tremendous and sonorous words” (W, 32) For the first time, both
are aware of the intense emotion language can not only work to capture, but also that it
can inspire in the recipient. Not surprisingly Stephen experiences this early wave of
linguistically inspired emotion physically, in the form of a “tremor pass[ing] over his
body”.

Understanding the Power of Language: Words as Objects
As experiences accumulate, borrowed language is flooded with meaning, which in
turn imbues words with a power the young individuals did not previously realize.
Children often get a sense of the strength of language when they learn that certain words
are not appropriate in particular places or around specific people, themselves included.
Stephen grows up hearing things from his mother directed at their friends, such as “you
should not speak that way before Stephen. It’s not right” (J, 33), and when he hears about
the older boys who steal from the church, he wonders, “How could they have done that?
… It was not the chapel but still you had to speak under your breath. It was a holy place”
(J, 40). Comparable to the logic Stephen employs when reflecting on Father Arnall’s
tendency to get angry, he reasons that the chapel is holy and you can not speak loudly
there, so all places where you can not speak loudly must be holy; you can not speak
loudly in the place the boys stole from, so they must have violated a holy place.
As this developmental stage is reached -- namely, the stage in which children start
to understand the tremendous power words can have -- they begin to refer to words as

94
objects, describing how “‘words fall cold on [their] head like paving-stones’” (W, 35)
and “‘those are white words...like stones one picks up by the seashore’” (W, 20). Jinny
says, “‘those are yellow words, those are fiery words…I should like a fiery dress, a
yellow dress, a fulvous dress to wear in the evening’” (W, 20). While this train of thought
could be perceived as the product of a child’s short attention span, the pointed
comparison of words to clothing highlights the unique relationship of children to
language at this developmental stage; they are beginning to understand words not as
simply parroted phrases but as tools filled with meaning, instruments to be selected with
agency, much like an item of clothing. Just as parents dress children in clothing until they
are a certain age, so too do they dress them in phrases and ideologies; clothing changes
one’s appearance just as the language they choose to use changes the way we perceive
them. We can modify our outfit depending on what the occasion demands, just as one can
adapt one’s diction and manner of speaking. The children speculate that “‘a good phrase,
however, seems…to have an independent existence’” (W, 68), highlighting the newly
discovered power of verbal communication, so potent it can seem not to simply capture
emotions or concepts, but to stand in place of them. Neville in particular appreciates “‘the
exactitude of the Latin language’” and says he will “‘step firmly upon the well-laid
sentences, and pronounce the explicit…and chant with a passion that is never obscure or
formless’” (W, 31). His love is partially because of the language’s adherence to a clear,
“explicit” set of rules and partially because of its power. With her diction and imagery,
Woolf likens the Latin language to a reliable, sturdy and economical bridge that connects
the speaker and the listener.

95
“The time approaches when these soliloquies will be shared”: The Power of
Language to Create Context
As the individual begins to know from experience that language has specific
powers, its uses increase; language not only connects people, but it binds events together
into stories, joining disparate happenings into a more palatable whole. “‘Let [Bernard]
describe what we have all seen so that it becomes a sequence,’” says Neville (W, 37).
Stringing together seemingly exclusive occasions into a ‘story’ creates a context, and just
as children gravitate toward straightforward schema, identifying a pattern or other uniting
quality in events that appear random -- and thus intimidating -- gives great comfort.
Additionally, language can be used to secure isolated events or sequences of events in
time, and the job of the poet, the storyteller, the scholar, is to capture and later access
those time periods through the words with which they were recorded. “‘Now let me try,’
said Louis, ‘before we…go to tea, to fix this moment in one effort of supreme endeavor.
This shall endure…this [scene] I see for a second, and shall try tonight to fix in words, to
forge in a ring of steel’” (W, 40). This desire not only indicates a newfound faith in
language -- that it has the ability to encapsulate moments before they fade -- but it also
suggests a heightened self awareness in relation to the progression of time; a sense of
futurity is only possible when one understands oneself as a consistent existence, as
exemplified by Rochat’s 5th level of awareness, “Permanence” (Rochat, 722). “A
permanent self is expressed,” he writes, “an entity that is represented as invariant over
time and appearance changes.” While the characters are not static identities, they at least
understand that there is endurance to the ‘self’ and that even if one changes one is still
oneself.

96
This notion of self-permanence develops along with improved language skills,
and as young people’s grasp on language steadies they are consequently further from the
first fragile space of childhood. The combination of natural progression away from
infancy and childhood combined with improved language skills allow the young
individuals to connect with one another. “‘The time approaches when these soliloquies
shall be shared.”” Louis says. “‘We shall not always give out a sound like a beaten gong
as one sensation strikes and then another. Children, our lives have been gongs striking,
clamour and boasting; cries of despair’” (W, 40) As the characters improve their ability
to use language deliberately and meaningfully, the space between them seems to
decrease. Their “soliloquies”, or lifelong internal thoughts, can be expressed, and thus the
development of language is imperative to the fulfillment of Maslow’s third, fourth, and
final steps: love and belongingness, esteem, and self-actualization. To truly feel a sense
of belonging or a sense that one is held in high esteem, one must feel like one is
understood by surrounding friends and family, and one of the best ways to do that is by
expressing one’s thoughts, ideas, and opinions through language.
For Woolf, much of the fear and uncertainty surrounding childhood is due to
children’s inability to express what they are feeling and experiencing. They cannot
explain to their peers or parents all the new sensations they are being bombarded with,
and the result is an early life of confusion and “sensation strik[ing]”. Note that Louis does
not announce that the time “when these soliloquies shall be shared” is now – instead, he
points out that the time is approaching, implying that he is aware of the power of
language for the first time but not fully in control of it. As experience fills in previously
meaningless words, the young individuals recognize the astounding capacity for

97
expression, specifically for their own. When Susan feels that Bernard is better able to
manage language than she is, she says to him, “ ‘now you trail away…making phrases.
Now you mount like an air-ball’s string, higher and higher through layers of the leaves,
out of reach… making phrases. You have escaped me” (W, 18). Linguistic
communication is a means to escaping the loneliness inflicted upon those who cannot
express their thoughts and feelings. Susan is aware of this almost mystic quality and yet
cannot quite command her words in the same powerful manner. Bernard is also gifted in
using his words to interact with other people. He describes his conversations as follows:
“a smoke ring issues from my lips (about crops) and circles [a man on the train], bringing
him into contact. The human voice has a disarming quality -- (we are not single, we are
one). As we exchange these few but amiable remarks, about country houses, I furbish
him up and make him concrete” (W, 68). Because he is aware of the immense capabilities
of words, he imagines them in tangible form, as “a smoke ring”. This image also implies
that there is a limit to the control one has over language, and that once one puts words
forth into the world they float off and dissipate in the way that smoke does. Woolf paints
verbal communication in a beautiful manner, illustrating its enticing nature; words can
seduce and enthrall, and either by Bernard’s imagined narration of this man’s life or by
the man using language to convey his story, he is suddenly “concrete” to Bernard.
Naming and Cherry’s “Cocktail Party Effect” (1953)
On a much more basic level than emotional expression, we use words to refer to
objects, giving each item a name that is either arbitrary or reflective of some inherent
quality. We also name people, and one of Stephen’s early philosophic struggles is with
the name of ‘God’ versus god’s ‘true’ identity: “But though there were different names

98
for God in all the different languages in the world …still God remained always the same
God and God’s real name was God” (J, 13). Though Stephen begins to understand that a
name is simply one way to define someone or something and that there is some ‘true’
essence to everyone or everything, he has difficulty comprehending the separation
between signifier and signified. In fact, the first instance of bullying we see in the novel
is when Stephen is teased about his name in the following exchange:
-What is your name?
Stephen had answered:
-Stephen Dedalus.
Then Nasty Roche had said:
-what kind of a name is that? (J, 5)
Implicit in this explicit inquiry around Stephen’s name is a recognition of Stephen as an
‘other’, as a person singled out from the group and made to identify himself. It is both
flattering and nerve-wracking when someone asks you your name: you have sparked the
interest of the questioning party, are isolated from the group, and are the only one meant
to answer that question. While a parent or peer could easily interject and give your name
for you, “what is your name?” is one of the first questions posed that recognizes us as
sentient individuals.
Children typically learn their name even before their age, as there is a supposed
unique quality to a name as opposed to an age; there are many four-year-olds, but one
likes to think that there is only one ‘Stephen Dedalus’, ‘Jessica Lebovits’, or ‘Virginia
Woolf’. People are also more likely to pick up on their own name in a noisy crowd, a
phenomenon cognitive scientist Edward Colin Cherry coined as the “cocktail party
effect” in 1953. Research shows that this own-name recognition develops very early; in a
study conducted by Rochelle S. Newman (2005), Newman explored five-month-old,

99
nine-month-old, and 13-month-old infants’ ability to recognize their own name in the
context of noise. Though all three age groups listened longer to their names when the
target voice was 10dB more intense than background noise, only 13-month-olds were
also able to select their own name when the target voice was only 5dB louder than
background noise. This demonstrates that the self-name relationship is in place at an
extremely young age, and that it strengthens as one grows older. Additionally, if when
someone asks your name it means that they are taking the time to recognize and learn
about you, it can be insulting when they cannot remember your name after they’ve asked;
Stephen “heard the voice of the prefect of studies asking him twice what his name was.
Why could he not remember the name when he was told the first time? Was he not
listening the first time or was it to make fun out of the name?” (J, 57) Words stand in for
concepts, names stand in for people, therefore we feel that our name represents an aspect
of we are. It is significant then that between 86%-92% of women change their name
when they get married (Bindley, 2011), indicating almost a shift in identity from young
maiden to wife and potentially mother.

Self-Identification and The Other: With or Against?
When Stephen is asked about his name, he is first pleased that he is singled out,
and then terrified by the ostracism. He notes that “the great men in history had names
like [his] and nobody made fun of them” (J, 57), meaning he wishes to blend in enough
not to be teased, yet he is insulted when the prefect does not recognize him and forgets
his name. Thus Stephen and the other characters approach the next step in their identity
formation, and alternately want to be singled out yet indistinguishable from the crowd;
according to Maslow one needs both love and belongingness as well as esteem to become

100
self-actualized, yet being esteemed by others requires that they recognize you as a
separate individual. Both Joyce and Woolf explore the various ways of establishing
oneself in relation to ‘the other’-- either in opposition to or in concurrence with; while
Joyce traces alternating orientations within one character (i.e. Stephen), Woolf
investigates them in six characters, allotting one mode of self-establishment for each -for example, Jinny thrives on being singled out, while Louis greatly prefers the solidarity
of the group.
As stressed earlier, children first experience their surroundings through their
bodies, and thus their first forms of self-identification are also physically tied. “‘I am a
boy in a gray flannel suit’” (W, 13) says Louis. “‘My mother still knits white socks for
me and hems pinafores and I am a child’” (W, 16) Susan narrates. After these neutral
physical observations come concrete physical observations that are now examined in
relation to ‘the other’; “‘my father is a banker in Brisbane and I speak with an Australian
accent. I will wait and copy Bernard. He is English. They are all English’” (W, 19)
worries Louis; “‘I am squat…I am short…. my eyes are hard. Jinny’s eyes break into a
thousand lights. Rhoda’s are like those pale flowers to which moths come in the
evening’” (W, 16). Children first recognize defining physical qualities about themselves,
then about themselves in relation to their peers: Louis defines himself first by what he is
wearing, and then later by what makes him different from his friends. Susan too lists
qualities about herself that are independent of fellow children – i.e. “‘my mother
knits…for me…and I am a child’”- and later views her physicality in comparison to her
female friends – i.e. “‘my eyes are hard. Jinny’s eye’s break into a thousand lights.’”
Even Jinny, arguably the most confident of all the children, takes issue with certain

101
aspects of her body, adamantly reporting, “‘I hate the small looking-glass …my lips are
too wide, and my eyes are too close together; I show my gums too much when I laugh.
Susan’s head … with its grass-green eyes which poets will love… put mine out’” (W, 42)
On her own Jinny is very comfortable with her physical appearance, relishing her own
energy and ability to be present. “‘I leap like one of those flames that run between the
cracks of the earth,’” she says, “‘I move, I dance; I never cease to move and dance’” (W,
42) Yet when she places herself in contrast to Rhoda and Susan her self-esteem falters, as
she understands herself as an object of scrutiny and judgment for the first time as well.
Because of this typical harsh self-judgment, Maslow divides ‘esteem’ – the
penultimate stage of human needs – into two categories, self-esteem and esteem others
have for you. Though both are necessary to become self-actualized, self-esteem is listed
as the ‘higher’ esteem, because it is both more essential and harder to come by. One can
be respected by others and not have any self-respect, and “thwarting of these needs
produces feelings of inferiority, of weakness, and of helplessness.” Maslow goes on to
say that “these feelings in turn give rise to either basic discouragement or else
compensatory or neurotic trends” (M, 382). The characters in both novels attempt to
assuage this low self-esteem in the same way they attempt to forge their identity – by
considering the inevitability of their comparison to their peers and deciding if its best to
go with them or go against them. Yet whichever path the individual resolves to take, the
degree to which he or she can truly separate from the social world is limited; even when
one defines oneself against the other, one is still dependent on that collective ‘other’ to
set social standards of ‘the norm’, against which one can orient oneself.

102
Some of our earliest opportunities for self-definition emerge from our relation to
‘the other’ -- initially this is our family, then grows to include our peers, and then the rest
of the social world.
Nasty Roche had asked [Stephen]
-What is your father?
Stephen had answered:
- A gentleman (5)
After Roche asks Stephen his name and singles him out, he is unsatisfied with the
answer, and instead endeavors to know him in a more encompassing social context – i.e.,
his family. Similarly, Stephen explores his physical and existential world position by
writing in his notebook him name, his classroom, his school, town, county, country,
continent and universe (J, 12).
“‘If my legs were reinforced by theirs, how they would run!’”: Self-Definition
Through Joining the Other
Both Woolf and Joyce take advantage of the microcosm of the school environment to
explore the notion of self vs. other; Stephen, Louis, and Neville long to be included in the
prestigious world of masculine academia, lusting after the older boys who make up the
ranks they long to join. “It pained [Stephen] that he did not know well what politics
meant and that he did not know where the universe ended. He felt small and weak. When
would he be like the fellows in poetry and rhetoric? They had big voices and big boots
and they studied trigonometry” (J, 14). Stephen is only limited by his age, but he wants to
cease feeling “small and weak” and instead be like the older boys whom he admires.
Likewise, Louis marvels at the unified nature of the academic elders at his school. “‘They
salute simultaneously passing the figure of their general.’” He describes. “‘How majestic
is their order, how beautiful is their obedience...I note the simultaneity of their

103
movements with delight’” (W, 47). To a callow, unsure boy seeking something with
which to align himself, the almost impenetrable synchronization of the men is immensely
appealing. “‘If I could follow,’” he continues, “‘if I could be with them I would sacrifice
all I know... that is what we wish to be, Neville and I. I watch them go with envy… If my
legs were reinforced by theirs, how they would run!’” (W, 47) The men operate together,
adhering to a set of clear, solid rules – at this age, the characters are finally aware of their
permanence, aware of needing to create schema, and attracted to a social setting that not
only presents itself simply and logically, but seemingly does not have any space in which
one must think for oneself. Rather than needing to rely only on his own two legs, Louis
reasons that if his “‘legs were reinforced by theirs, how they would run!’” Floating
around the free world, Louis and the others must take risks and establish themselves,
forming a hodgepodge group of individuals all fighting to be heard. Alternatively, if he
were part of a more unified group of people that functions as a complicated but smooth
machine, he could focus on what he is told to do rather than having to be self-reflective
and figure out what he wants to do. As he and the others march into the chapel, “‘two by
two…orderly, professional…[they] put off [their] distinctions’” (W, 34). There is no need
to fret about what distinguishes him from his peers, because the goal has shifted away
from individual prominence and towards blending in with the group, which strengthens
the individual’s identity by focusing on shared characteristics. “‘I recover my continuity,
as he reads,’” says Louis in church, “‘I become a figure in the procession, a spoke in the
huge wheel that turning, at last erects me, here and now. I have been in the dark; I have
been hidden… There is no crudity here, no sudden kisses’” (W, 35). Instead, there is a
clear order and consequently a sense of control.

104
Being part of a group contextualizes and roots the individual, and he then he finds his
“continuity”, or a compelling reason that aligns all his disparate thoughts and beliefs.
Neville feels similarly, and confesses, “‘nobody guessed the need I had to offer my being
to one god; and perish, and disappear’” (W, 52). In the tumultuousness of identity
formation, the notion of shifting one’s focus from oneself to a god, a goal, or a group is
enormously appealing. Dedication to a higher purpose gives life meaning, and
understanding oneself in a larger context -- historical, religious, social -- soothes smaller
day-to-day problems. If one is entirely absorbed by a cause larger than oneself, the
pressure of individual life is alleviated; “‘then there was wind and violent thunder’”
Rhoda says, “‘There was a star riding through the clouds one night, and I said to the star
‘Consume me’’” (W, 64). This desire to cease existence is theoretically the manifestation
of the ultimate show of support: if one is dedicated to and thus supported by a god, a
belief, a star, one’s personal distinctions are lost and one’s identity is solely that of the
larger object.
“To be summoned”: Self-Definition Through Singularity
On the other hand, Jinny resolves to go the route of singularity, establishing
herself as an individual who is separate from the group. Jinny’s particular mode of
distinction is dangerous however, in that she is not the one separating herself, but rather
is waiting around to be separated. Though she thrives on being different from ‘the other’,
she relies on ‘the other’ to pick her out from the crowd and dub her as different. It is
therefore not much different from the desire to dedicate oneself entirely to a higher being;
Jinny is drawn to an extremely passive and risky mode of self-identification, always
dependent on and therefore at the mercy of the (typically masculine) ‘other’, just as the

105
religious fanatic is dependent on and at the mercy of a higher cause. Even before Jinny
experiences the sexual undertones of being noticed for her unique corporeal beauty, she
wants to be recognized for something only she possesses. “‘I begin to feel the wish to be
singled out;’” she says, “‘to be summoned, to be called away by one person who comes
to find me, who is attracted towards me, who cannot keep himself from me, but comes to
where I sit’” (W, 46). Jinny’s youthful aspirations are remarkably passive, as she wants to
be “summoned, to be called away” – in other words, she wants someone to want her, as
opposed to wanting someone or something because she as a separate entity desires it. In
many ways, the establishing of oneself in opposition to others is perhaps more dependent
on ‘the other’ than overtly joining a group, because there is little agency.
When she is older, Jinny has her first true experience of being singled out,
specifically because of her gorgeous appearance.
He smiles at my reflection in the tunnel. My body instantly of its own accord puts
forth a frill under his gaze. My body lives a life of its own. …. But we have
exchanged the approval of our bodies. There is then a great society of bodies, and
mine is introduced; …and the men … are aware too, as I am aware, of heat and
rapture…. I give myself up to rapture…but behold, looking up, I meet the eyes of
a sour woman, who suspects me of rapture. My body shuts in her face,
impertinently, like a parasol. I open my body, I shut my body at will. Life is
beginning. (W, 63)
It is important to note that this entire exchange is due to a fellow passenger seeing Jinny’s
reflection, as opposed to staring directly at her. Though his observance and appreciation
of her beauty in her reflection in the window allows him the same visual clarity as
looking directly at her would, the fact that this interaction takes place between Jinny, the
man, and Jinny’s reflection is essential to understanding the delicate danger she places
herself in by allowing herself to be defined entirely by the other. In this manner, Jinny is
only a partial player, nearly inconsequential in who she truly is when compared to her

106
physical beauty; this attractiveness is part of her to an extent, but symbolically separated
from her in this passage. Her “‘body instantly of its own accord’” reacts, also strangely
distant from Jinny’s individuality or identity. Her “‘body lives a life of its own’”, and
because of that she, Jinny, “‘give[s her]self up to rapture’” after it is incited by her body,
almost as if she is surrendering to it – this pushes her body ahead of her in rank, making
‘it’ more powerful than ‘she’. By the end of the passage she still discusses her body as
distinct from the rest of her, yet she gains a degree of control over it, able to “‘open [her]
body… shut [her] body at will’”.
Woolf opens a brief discussion of the taboo nature of female sexuality and
“‘rapture’”, as it is something that Jinny is “‘suspect[ed]’” of. If one’s activities warrant
suspicion, it is implied that they are controversial, clandestine, sinful. Jinny’s physical
reaction to this skepticism is also beautifully symbolic – her “‘body shuts in [the
woman’s] face, impertinently, like a parasol’”. A parasol is the epitome of femininity, a
delicate, intricate, fragile item that protects modesty and upholds tradition. The fact that
her body reacts this way “‘impertinently’” could refer to Jinny’s agency – i.e. she ‘shuts’
her body irreverently and thus offends the older, more traditional female figure – or it
could suggest that Jinny and her body are not relevant, not pertinent, to the current scene,
furthering her dependence on the other to shape and define her.

The Inevitability of Social Self-Definition
Though Jinny identifies herself by how she stands out from the crowd, she is
extremely dependent on that crowd to give her something with which to contrast her
identity. Alternatively, the characters who define themselves in more collectivist terms
are perhaps less dependent on ‘the other’, if all the individuals dedicate themselves to one

107
larger cause, then theoretically those people could continue identifying with the cause
even in the absence of their peers. It is futile to speculate however, because whether one
is basing one’s identity with the group or against the group, the presence of a social
‘other’ is inevitable, and its support is essential to self-definition. For the characters who
wish to dedicate themselves to the good of the group, it is obvious to discern where the
social support comes from; if they emphasize shared characteristics and downplay their
differences, there is a strength in numbers that works to contextualize the individual.
Rather than worrying about how to fight for distinction and forge a new model for being
recognized, the collectively minded individuals can embrace the similarity of the group
and thus gain support for fine-tuning their identities. For those who establish themselves
in opposition, there is a heightened reliance on the other for support, though the support
comes in a more subtle form; if you are singling yourself out or waiting to be singled out,
you are trusting the other to first recognize and then ‘approve’ of you, and agree as a
collective social body that you are different from them. There must be an agreement on
the part of ‘the other’ that you are not like them, and therefore warrant attention and
distinction or suspicion. It is arguably worse to be ignored than insulted. When one is
insulted, one is still recognized by the other, whereas when one is ignored, one is not
even granted the decency of acknowledgement. Without that support of recognition and
subsequent evaluation– albeit a strange manifestation of support – the individual cannot
fulfill the love and belongingness nor the esteem category of Maslow’s hierarchy, and
therefore is unable to reach self-actualization.
The ever-shifting but always vital relationship between the self and the other is
exemplified succinctly and eloquently in the following paragraph, taken from the end of

108
the first section of A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man. Before this scene, Stephen
has been caned by the prefect of studies, and then confronts the rector about the
unfairness of the situation. After his protest is registered, he then leaves the rector’s office
and returns to his peers.
They made a cradle of their locked hands and hoisted him up among them and
carried him along till he struggled to get free. And when he had escaped from
them they broke away in all directions, flinging their caps again into the air and
whistling as they went spinning up and crying:
- hurroo! (J, 60)
Out of the group of students, Stephen is singled out for not doing his classwork, despite
the fact that his glasses were broken and his teacher had previously excused him from his
studies. He is then hit in front of the entire class, further isolating him with shame,
embarrassment, and pain. After the incident he is absorbed back into the group, “and
every fellow had said it was unfair” (J, 55) that he was punished. His peers stand by him,
consoling him with their validation of his side of the story. The relationship then shifts
again, and the comforting group gently singles Stephen out another time, urging him to
go forth and explain to the rector what has happened; in this case, the singling out of
Stephen is a demonstration of social support and esteem rather than cruel ostracism. He
is then strong enough to go alone into a difficult situation. Had it not been for the support
and encouragement of his peers, he would not have successfully presented his argument
to the rector and been absolved of his supposed crime. This oscillating relationship is
exemplified by the sudden shift in diction in the quoted passage; when Stephen returns
from his lone journey, the group makes a “cradle” out of their “locked” hands,
demonstrating literal and metaphoric support. A “cradle” is obviously reminiscent of
infants, and thus the passage sets itself up to be a synecdoche for the self and the other

109
throughout a lifetime. Stephen is then lifted up above their heads, but Joyce chooses to
say that he is “hoisted up among them” – the term “hoisted” implies being lifted up for a
specific goal, i.e. to reach something tall, and Stephen is “among them”, as opposed to
‘above’ or ‘separate from’ them. He is “carried…along” like a child, and the first part of
the sentence mimics the early part of life, where one must be taken care of physically and
emotionally by one’s social environment in order to ultimately reach self-actualization.
After he is “carried,” however, the diction shift occurs: suddenly Stephen
“struggled” to come away “free”, immediately altering the caring connotation of the
carrying and making it seem almost imprisoning. If he is trying to get “free”, that implies
that he was not free before, and perhaps even felt trapped. He then “escaped” and the
group “broke away in all direction” -- he did not simply separate from them, but rather
violently “escaped”, and the suddenness of the motion is further emphasized by the
turbulence of the group’s dispersion. In keeping with this paragraph as a miniature model
for the self-other relationship throughout the individual’s lifetime, the tumultuousness of
the central part of the sentence is representative of adolescent years, a time of deliberate
and severe separation of the self and the other. The scene ends on a more positive note
however, once Stephen is detached from the group and the other boys “fling… their
caps…into the air and whistl[e]” happily. Though he is not physically part of the group
any more, he is also no longer isolated or excluded; rather, he is peacefully coexisting
with ‘the other’, only able to be a confident individual because of the support given to
him early on in the scene, or early on in his life.

110

Conclusion
Though the majority of psychological theorists that I have mentioned here came
after Virginia Woolf and James Joyce, I believe that the ease with which their work
blends with current psychological findings further emphasizes the uniqueness of their
novels, and perhaps of Modernist literature in general. Through their abstract aesthetic
representations of cognition and identity, Woolf and Joyce anticipate developmental
theories put forth by psychology, adding invaluable emotional perspective to ideas that
can also be known through less personal means, as is the typical format for psychological
empirical study. “We are trembling on the verge of one of the great ages of English
literature” (Woolf, 12), Woolf wrote in 1923, and in my humble opinion she was correct.
Through narration of the “stream of consciousness,” she and Joyce attempt and succeed
at painting the individual in a light that meshes his or her own subjective views, their
society’s views and the author’s view, all the while building in a space for the reader to
fill in his or her own opinions as well: “for example, [each character] will strike you very
differently according to the age and country in which you happen to be born,” Woolf
continues. “You see one thing in character, and I another. You say it means this, and I
that” (Woolf, 4).

111

Conclusion
Our conception of ourselves is largely mediated by our society, by its opinions in
general and, more specifically, its opinion of us. These conceptions (of ourselves, of our
peers, of our society) shape the way we absorb art and literature, which subsequently
affects what type of art and literature we, as a society, produce. This reciprocal process is
comparable to the relationship between the individual and his or her native language,
both in that a) literature is comprised of words which, as members of a particular society,
will have a particular meaning to us, and b) because our conception of ourselves cannot
be disentangled from our language, from the way our society uses that language, and
from society itself. Understanding the myriad levels of mediation leaves the investigator
(the author, the individual, myself) with feelings of despair and powerlessness -- how will
I understand myself if I cannot remove myself from myself, from my society, from my
influences? How will I understand others, knowing my perspective is hopelessly limited
and subjective?
I have attempted to alleviate these issues in the multidisciplinary project, by
combining literature and psychology -- the subjective and the objective, the aesthetic and
the empirical -- and forging for myself as complete a picture of identity formation as I
can conceive of, while working within realistic limitations. What the literary
representations appear to be improvising, psychology confirms or denies, and what the
statistically valid experiments can lack in empathetic representation, the literature brings
to life and makes resonant. Therefore, the two approaches should not – and arguably
cannot – be separated. As William James said in The Principles of Psychology, science
“must be constantly reminded that her purposes are not the only purposes, and that the

112
order of uniform causation which she has use for, and is therefore right in postulating,
may be enveloped in a wider order, on which she has no claims at all” (James, 1179). I
would argue this same ‘reminder’ be issued for literature as well, and for other disciplines
-- when studied in isolation, both literature and psychology are cheated, are not explored
to their full potential. As Woolf’s Bernard says, “‘I do not believe in separation. We are
not single…we are one’” (W, 67).
I have tried to keep both James’ and Bernard’s dictum in mind throughout the
creation of this project, during research, outlining, drafting, editing, and rewriting. I
continually strove to balance the differing approaches, taking care to not push either my
psychology research or my literature analysis too far into itself, for fear of losing track of
the other. Yet each time the concern crossed my mind, the material would surprise me,
and I was perpetually confronted with the very reasons I undertook this multidisciplinary
investigation; when I least expected to forge a connection between Woolf and Maslow,
Joyce and Rochat, Modernism and developmental psychology, sure enough one would
arise. A child’s response would call to mind something Woolf’s Bernard said, or Joyce
would eloquently portray a trend in early childhood that has been a focus of
developmental psychologists for years. I would be astonished by the findings of an
empirical study, moved by a literary passage, and within a short span of time the other
discipline would reveal to me the same phenomenon, distilled down to its essence and
manifested again in another form. These luminous moments of connection always
seemed to come at precisely the right moment, at a hiccup in my work, a brief standstill;
if it were not utterly beyond the realm of possibility I would have suspected the two fields
to be talking to each other, conspiring and collaborating, unbeknownst to me.

113
The ultimate and, for me, most poignant link came recently, as I sat down to write
my conclusion. Informal and unconventional as it may be for me to share the intimacies
of my writing process at the end of a lengthy academic endeavor, the manner in which
this last connection brought itself to my attention is particularly profound. Determined to
have a conclusion that not only recapitulated my project, but also delighted and moved
my readers, I turned again to the original texts I worked so closely with, The Waves by
Virginia Woolf and A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man by James Joyce, in search of
the perfect parting quotation. I re-read the last page of the section I heavily explicated in
The Waves, as well as the final and famed passages of A Portrait. As Neville steps off the
train after graduation, ready to begin his life as a young adult, he says, “‘I feel
insignificant, lost, but exultant’” (W, 72). He “‘grasp[s] tightly all that [he] possess[es in]
one bag’” and steps off the platform, into “‘that chaos, that tumult.’” In A Portrait,
Stephen readies himself to leave home, and “learn in [his] own life and away from home
and friends what the heart is and what it feels” (J, 275). He describes the tacit pull of his
equally restless peers: “the voices say…We are your kinsmen. And the air is thick with
their company as they call to me, their kinsman, making ready to go, shaking the wings
of their exultant and terrible youth.”
The repeated word then immediately jumped out at me; exultant. In the entirety of
my time reading and analyzing both novels, never did two passages -- read one after the
other, no less -- echo each other so beautifully, and resonate with a shared idea so
harmoniously. Exultant. Adjective. “Triumphantly happy”. Woolf and Joyce both
describe the state of their characters as such at pivotal points, instances crucial to the
rhythm of the novel as well as the characters’ lives; Neville is exiting a train that has

114
taken him from his childhood and adolescence to his newfound freedom and adulthood,
and Stephen is poised on the precipice of his young adulthood, days away from his
renowned invitation, “Welcome, O life!” (J, 275). There is something about this word
then, exultant, that reaches the core of what it means to be young, that correctly identifies
something inherent in the collision of childhood and adulthood. Perhaps it is because of
the mastery of the Modernist writers; perhaps because of the sentimentality I feel as I
approach the end of this comprehensive project, which has been gestating within me for
quite some time; or perhaps because I, too am facing the intersection of adolescence and
young adulthood; but “exultance”, mixed with Neville’s “‘chaos [and] tumult’” and the
“terrible[ness]” of Stephen’s youth, seems to capture this particular stage of life. Stephen,
Neville, and the other characters are beginning the first chapter of their new life, their
childhood having been a wonderful, fragile, and necessary prologue. They are aware of
who they are and yet blissfully aware of all that they can still be, all that they can achieve,
all that they can attain. To put it in Maslow’s terms, they are rapidly moving towards selfactualization, understanding that “what [they] can be, [they] must be” (M, 382).
It is the beauty of this particular life position, this period of pure exultance, that
makes the study of childhood and adolescence worthwhile; rather than the light,
inconsequential joy one feels as a child, or the blind, instantaneous triumph (as a young
Jinny said, “‘all is quickness and triumph’” (W, 46)), exultance combines the two,
lending weight and significance to each component. One can be happy with no real cause,
and one can feel triumph without truly overcoming adversity; in order to feel
triumphantly happy, however, one must conquer, prevail, over distress and hardship, and
subsequently appreciate the euphoria as an emotion earned and made sweeter by the

115
difficulty that came before it. Exultance is therefore the matured iteration of happiness, as
it is a nuanced type of joy known only by those who have experienced both pleasure and
pain, success and failure. To refer back to the Rilke quotation which opens my project,
“children are still the way you were as a child…and if you think of your childhood, you
once again live among them.” In this same mode of thought, I posit that the exultance
with which the young characters in Woolf and Joyce’s novels approach their new lives
can -- and should be -- maintained throughout the lifetime. In studying childhood and
adolescent self-concept from the beginning through the very end where adolescence
meets adulthood, I argue that this precious period of self-actualization does not have to be
dependent on a particular chronological age, but rather is indicative of a particular
mindset; while this attitude may not emerge until young adulthood, the balance of selfawareness and awareness of one’s potential can -- and should -- be sustained.
Studying the way children and adolescents construct their identity has inspired me
to take their joy and their triumph and combine it with my own life experiences, creating
and sustaining the exultance that is integral to Joyce and Woolf’s conception of young
adulthood. It is about balancing metaphoric potential energy with metaphoric kinetic
energy -- making sure we are moving, creating, pushing forth with our lives (kinetic)
while never forgetting that within us is infinite potential energy, which renews itself with
each new experience. We as a culture envy children and the seemingly innumerable paths
their lives can take, while somehow forgetting or neglecting that we, too have the power
to shift the course of our lives, if only we can muster up the childish excitement of simply
living and channel it into matured exultance. Rather than wishing to be children, we
should wish to be as open as possible in learning from them; we must maintain their

116
wonder, delight, indulgence and ability to be present and combine it with the wisdom,
self-control, determination and knowledge that only comes with age. In the personal
responses I gathered from the children, I could see the beginnings of the difficult
amalgamation of youth and age, and had I continued to ask adolescents, young adults,
and adults to contribute to my study, I imagine the juggling act would have both
intensified and gotten easier.
In a letter dated July 16, 1903 the German poet Rainer Maria Rilke asks his
anxious correspondent to sit with the questions he has about his life, rather than franticly
look for answers. Though this particular plea is directed at an aspiring teenage poet, I
propose that, like the sustaining of youthful exultance, Rilke’s words are not only
relevant to the young inquirer; rather, they are invaluable to thinkers of all ages, to any
individual who has ever questioned herself, or the world around her. I will thus end as I
began, with a beloved quotation of Rilke’s, whose sage advice has been to me, in my
inevitable hours of questioning and self-reflection, ineffably sweet.
You are so young, so much before all beginning, and I would like to beg you, dear
sir, as well as I can, to have patience with everything unresolved in your heart and
to try to love the questions themselves as if they were locked rooms or books
written in a very foreign language. Don’t search for the answers, which could not
be given to you now, because you would not be able to live them. And the point
is, to live everything. Live the questions now. Perhaps then, someday far in the
future, you will gradually, without even noticing it, live your way into the
answer….but take whatever comes, with great trust, and as long as it comes out of
your will, out of some need of your innermost self, then take it upon yourself, and
don’t hate anything.

Hello Principal King,
Thank you very for agreeing to meet with Professor D’Albertis on my behalf! My name
is Jessica Lebovits, and I am a senior at Bard College. I am majoring in literature and
psychology with a concentration in gender and sexuality studies, and within the
psychology department my interests are in developmental psychology and
psycholinguistics. For my upcoming senior project, I would like to focus on language
development and acquisition, exploring the broad topic through both main disciplines.
While I will be completing a related but separate literature-related section of the project,
for the psychology portion I am hoping to work with elementary, middle, and high
schools in the area to gather data in the form of students’ written work.
Let me preface my explanation of the specifics of the study by saying that I am very
grateful for any type of assistance you and Chancellor Livingston Elementary can offer –
if what I am proposing seems too difficult to implement, then I would love to
communicate with you further about a modified version of my project that would still
involve your students to any degree you feel would be possible.
I would ideally love to work with students from 2nd or 3rd grade through 12th grade- if
possible, every grade between them, but if not possible then perhaps every 3 or 4 years
(2nd, 5th, 8th, 11th). I am interested not only in how written language use evolves over a
student’s pre-college career, but specifically how the nuances in word choice and other
linguistic patterns are indicative of much more than what is on the surface. I would like to
come in to the classroom and ask the students to answer a writing prompt, giving them 30
minutes to complete their response. All responses would be completely anonymous, and I
would identify each student through their birth date (mm/dd/yy) which they can place
themselves at the top of the page, along with “male” or “female”. Each student that
participates – grade 2 through 12- will get the same prompt and the same amount of time
to respond. Though the precise wording of the prompt is not yet solidified, it would be
along the lines of: “What do you think is your best quality? Why? What is your least
favorite quality? Why? Explain both your favorite and least favorite qualities, giving
examples from your life in which you showed each quality.”
Through this series of questions I would like to analyze the development of:
understanding of emotions, emotional self-regulation, social relationships, perspective
taking skills, narrative construction and positive and negative idea of self-image. For
example, if a student responds that their least favorite quality is that they are bossy, then
they might describe a time in which they were bossy and upset a peer (demonstrating an
understanding of emotions, social relationships, perspective taking, narrative
construction) and explain that to try to be less bossy they counted to 10 every time they
got angry (emotional self-regulation).

I would then input the collected responses to a fascinating computer program that I have
been working with, called the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) program.
LIWC was created by the psychologist James Pennebaker and his colleagues that
analyzes text and categorizes it almost instantaneously into 82 different parts of speech.
For example, if I put in a student’s response, it would give me how many words were
used, average sentence length, percentage of the text that used first-person singular
pronouns, positive emotion words, future tense verbs, etc. (definitely visit
http://www.LIWC.net/ if you’re interested!) From this data I will be able to analyze the
written responses and compare various statistics; for example, what are the differences in
the types of language students use to describe their best quality (a positive self-image) vs.
their worst quality (a negative self-image)? Do they use more insight words (“think”,
“know”, “consider”) when describing their worst quality, suggesting a conscious
reevaluation of something they are not proud of? Is there a gender difference in the
ability to control and regulate emotions? What types of differences are there in the
responses of the 3rd graders vs. the 11th graders? Is there a common self-identified “best”
or “worst” quality among students of a certain age? Among each gender, regardless of the
age? Etc., etc.
Again, I understand that you, the teachers, and the students are always very busy, and that
often it is difficult enough to get through a predetermined curriculum without Bard
students coming in and trying to tack on extra work! Any way that you would be willing
to incorporate my research this upcoming year would be deeply appreciated. Though for
reasons of eliminating variables, etc it would be ideal to have the students complete the
prompt in-class in a set amount of time with me present, I am flexible and would be
willing to adapt my exploration; either to previously scheduled writing prompts, or to
have the teacher deliver my prompt, or to give the students the questions as homework.
Thank you very, very much for taking the time to speak with Professor D’Albertis and for
reading this perhaps overly detailed summary! Please do not hesitate to contact me with
any questions or comments.
Sincerely,
Jessica Lebovits

APPENDIX D
Dear Parent/Guardian,
My name is Jessica Lebovits, and I am a senior at Bard College. I am majoring in
literature and psychology with a concentration in gender studies, and within the
psychology department my interests are in developmental psychology and
psycholinguistics.
At Bard we are each asked to complete a senior project, and for the psychology portion of
that project I am focusing on childhood and adolescent development. Thanks to the
cooperation of the Rhinebeck principals, I am thrilled to be working with the Chancellor
Livingston Elementary, Bulkeley Middle School, and Rhinebeck High School to conduct
a study of students’ written work between 2nd and 11th grade. I am interested not only in
how written language use evolves over a student’s school career, but specifically how the
nuances in word choice and other linguistic patterns evolve as children get older.
I will be visiting your student’s classroom on XX/XX and will ask the participants to
answer a writing prompt, giving them 30 minutes to complete their response. All
responses will be completely anonymous, and I will identify each answer through the
student’s birth date (mm/dd/yy) which they can place themselves at the top of the page,
along with “male” or “female”. Each student that participates – grade 2 through 11- will
be given the same prompt and the same amount of time to respond. The responses will
then be collected and inputted into a language processing program that analyzes text and
categorizes it almost instantaneously into 82 different parts of speech. When I put in a
student’s response, the program will tell me how many words were used, average
sentence length, percentage of the text that used first-person singular pronouns, positive
emotion words, future tense verbs, etc. (visit http://www.LIWC.net/ if you’re interested!)
Each student’s response will be photocopied and sent home, along with a follow up letter
that further explains my research and the specific prompt your student has answered.
The responses collected will be used for the purposes of my senior project only, and like
all senior projects they final results will be available in the Bard library. If you do not
wish your child to participate, please send this form back to school with your child by
XX/XX. If you choose to excuse your child from the study, they will remain in their
classroom with their peers and complete the writing prompt and I will not collect their

“Words in category” refers to the number of different dictionary words that make up
the variable category; “Validity judges” reflect the simple correlations between judges’
ratings of the category with the LIWC variable (from Pennebaker & Francis, 1996).
“Alphas” refer to the Cronbach alphas for the internal reliability of the specific words
within each category. The binary alphas are computed on the occurrence/non-occurrence
of each dictionary word whereas the raw or uncorrected alphas are based on the
percentage of use of each of the category words within the texts. All alphas were
computed on a sample of 2800 randomly selected text files from our language corpus.
The LIWC dictionary generally arranges categories hierachically. For example, all
pronouns are included in the overarching category of function words. The category of
pronouns is the sum of personal and impersonal pronouns. There are some exceptions to
the hierarchy rules:
a
Common verbs are not included in the function word category. Similarly, common
verbs (as opposed to auxiliary verbs) that are tagged by verb tense are included in the
past, present, and future tense categories but not in the overall function word categories.
b
Social processes include a large group of words (originally used in LIWC2001) that
denote social processes, including all non-first-person-singular personal pronouns as well
as verbs that suggest human interaction (talking, sharing).
c
Perceptual processes include the entire dictionary of the Qualia category (which is a
separate dictionary), which includes multiple sensory and perceptual dimensions
associated with the five senses.

APPENDIX I
Verbal Script for Study (2nd and 5th grade)
Hello. My name is Jessica, and I’m a senior at Bard College. I’m a literature and
psychology major, and I’m very interested in developmental psychology, which studies
the way people change over their life. At Bard we’re asked to complete a long project
during our senior year, and for my project I’m looking at the different types of answers
students of all ages give when asked the same question.
Today you are going to be asked a question, given time to write a response, and then I
will collect your answers. Even though writing a response will be helpful to me, what
we’re doing today is not required, and you are allowed to stop at any point.
I’m going to give everyone a piece of paper that has a question on it. Please keep the
paper face down on your desk until I ask you to turn it over.
*hand out papers*
Does everyone have a paper? Does everyone have lined paper to write on? Does
everyone have something to write with?
Before you turn over the paper, please write your full birthday on the back, including the
month, the day and the year.
Once you have written your birthday, please write either “male” if you are a boy, or
“female” if you are a girl.
Please do not write your name on the piece of paper
On the other side of this piece of paper is a question. In a moment we will all turn the
paper over, I will read the question out loud, and then you will have 30 minutes to write
your response to the question. I will let you know when it has been 15 minutes, which
means that you will have 15 minutes more to finish writing. If you finish writing and
have extra time, please sit quietly at your desk. Do not worry if you run out of time.
Whatever you write will be completely anonymous, which means that there is no way for
anyone to find out who wrote what. Please be as honest as you can and remember that
there is no right or wrong answer to the question. Don’t worry about spelling – this is not
a test! Again, please remember that if you would like to stop at any time, you are allowed
to sit quietly at your desk.
Does anyone have any questions?
Ok, please turn over the piece of paper. The question says, “What do you think is your
best personality quality? What is a quality that you’d like to change? Explain your

responses. Give two examples from your life – one for each answer – in which you
demonstrated each quality.”
Can someone tell me what a personality quality is? How is that different from a physical
quality?
Does everyone know what the word “demonstrate” means? Does someone want to give
us a definition?
Are there any more questions?
If there are no more questions then let’s begin! I will let you know when 15 minutes have
passed. If you finish early, please sit quietly at your desk until I collect your responses.
Please be sure to answer all parts of the question. Thank you!
*after 15 minutes*
15 minutes have gone by, which means that you have 15 more minutes to complete your
response. Please be sure to answer all parts of the question. Again, if you have already
finished, please sit quietly at your desk until I collect your responses.
*after 15 more minutes*
Ok everyone, the 30 minutes are up. Please finish your sentence and turn your responses
over. I’m going to hand out paper clips. Please make sure that all the pieces of paper that
you wrote on are attached to the piece of paper that I handed out earlier.
*hand out paper clips*
*collect responses*
Thank you so much everyone! Now that you guys have helped me with my psychology
study, let me explain a bit more about what I’m looking at. I’m asking students in 2nd, 5th,
8th, and 11th grade this same question and collecting their responses just like I’ve
collected yours. Then I’m going to take these answers and put them into a computer
program that reads them very quickly and tells me what type of words each student or
groups of students used. For example, if I take all the answers from your class, the
computer program might tell me that half of you used words that talked about your
feelings, and it might tell me that boys used more verbs and girls used more nouns. Then
I’m going to compare all the answers that I get and see how children of different ages
answer the same question, how boys or girls answer the same question or how different
children of the same age answer the same question. It will take me a few months to go
over all of the answers, but I would be happy to come back soon and let you guys know
what I find.
Are there any last questions? Thank you very much for your participation!

opposed to a physical one. For example, writing about your amazing goalie skills would
be a physical quality, whereas writing about your patience or humor would be a
personality quality.

8th, and 11th grade this same question and collecting their responses just like I’ve
collected yours. Then I’m going to take these answers and put them into a computer
program that processes text and organizes it into different categories, such as pronouns,
verbs, “emotion words” like “happy”, “angry”, etc. The program then tells me what
percentage of the text is made up of these categories. For example, the program might say
that action words made up 20% of 2nd grade boys’ responses, and emotion words made
up 25% of 5th grade girls’ responses. Because everyone is responding to the same
question, I’m interested in comparing word use among ages as well as genders. I’m also
going to be looking at the different types of words that people use when talking about a
favorite quality of theirs vs. a quality of theirs that they’d like to change. It will take me a
few months to go over all the data, but I would be happy to come back in a few months
and share the results!
Are there any last questions? I will write my email address on the board incase anyone
thinks of anything they’d like to ask, as well as the website that describes the computer
program that I’m using. (jl517@bard.edu, http://www.liwc.net/ )
Thank you very much for your participation!

APPENDIX J
Dear Parent/Guardian,
Thank you for allowing your child to participate in my senior project research. Today,
XX/XX, I visited your child’s classroom and conducted the writing prompt that I
mentioned in a similar letter a few weeks earlier. Now that the data collection is
complete, please let me further explain today’s activity as well as the focus of my
research.
In class I explained that I was going to ask a question, everyone would have 30 minutes
to answer the question, and then I would collect the responses. I reminded the students
that participation was not required and that their answers would be entirely anonymous.
We then read the prompt out loud, answered any questions they had regarding the
meaning of the prompt, and began writing. The written prompt that all students in my
study - grades 2, 5, 8 and 11- is as follows; “What do you think is your best personality
quality? What is a quality that you’d like to change? Explain your responses. Give two
examples from your life – one for each answer – in which you demonstrated each
quality.”
By asking all students this open-ended yet specific set of questions, I am hoping to
analyze a few aspects of child development, particularly the idea of self-image. I’m
interested in the conflicting ways that students talk about things they are proud of (their
best personality quality, a positive self-image) versus aspects of themselves that they are
not as satisfied with (a negative self-image). Within this broad question of linguistic
variation, I would like to more closely analyze the different word choices between girls
and boys, as well as across ages. With the real life examples that I’ve asked students to
give, I’m hoping to study the development of the understanding of emotions, of social
relationships, of perspective taking, and of narrative construction. For example, if a
student responds that his least favorite quality is that he is bossy, then he might describe a
time in which he was bossy and upset a peer (demonstrating an understanding of
emotions, social relationships, perspective taking, narrative construction).
Once I have collected data from all the classrooms, I will be inputting the written work
into a language processing program called Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count
(www.LIWC.net if you’d like to learn more). This program organizes large blocks of text
into 82 different linguistic categories, such as first-person singular pronouns, positive
emotion words, action words, etc. By analyzing the percentage of types of words used in
each group (girls vs. boys, 3rd graders vs. 8th graders, 5th grade girls vs. 11th grade girls,
etc), I’m hoping to draw preliminary conclusions about the development of childhood
and adolescent self-image.
Thank you again very, very much for you and your child’s cooperation and participation.
Please do not hesitate to contact me with any questions or comments.
Sincerely,
Jessica Lebovits
