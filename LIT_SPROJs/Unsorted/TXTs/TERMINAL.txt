EZRA BENNETT GLENN

I was reading about how pyramids are really just girls sitting on
the ground dressed as triangles. I was reading about girls and what
it’s like to be a fly. I was flying in an airplane. The airplane was
on the ground sitting on the ground not moving but I was flying
around inside of it, like a bird trapped inside of a bigger bird which
is a dead bird. Sitting on the ground like a triangle sits pointing. I
was a dead bird and I texted my mom to say I’m not coming home
tonight on account of my death and all she responded was “driving.” She crashed the car into a fountain. I was swimming in a
fountain full of crabs but it was inside of my grandmother’s house
and the crabs were snapping at my neck and I was hanging upside
down like a dead girl. I had a dream where I was surrounded by
dead girls and candles in the shape of girls and as they melted they
looked more and more dead, like a triangle in the ground, buried
up to the tip, like a girl in the ground except her head wasn’t
there. It was a sex-dream except I didn’t dream the sex part, only
that is happened. I didn’t feel anything and it wasn’t fun. I didn’t
wake up sweating. I didn’t wake up. I didn’t go to sleep but when
I woke up from the dream I was sleeping. I was sleeping and all
of a sudden all of the boys and girls were sleeping forever and
they all had their underpants in their mouths and their mouths and
eyes were open and their fingers were closed and their wrists were
closed and tied close forming a triangle behind their necks spread
like birds with wings unfolded on the ground, in the ground. I felt
sorry for the ground for having to hold all of that. I felt sorry for
me and I felt really bad about the world trade center because it
was so poorly designed but then someone knocked it down and
he became the president. I was the president in my dream and I
spent all of my time knocking things down so I could have more
ground to put my things on and all of the people were my things
like I owned them or like I wanted to, like I could or would not
rest until I felt like I possessed something even greater and again
by some thing I mean some one I mean I was the president and I
accidentally went to war with my body and all of the bodies and
6

the ground could and would never look the same and triangles
don’t sit still like how things writhe and scream when you sit
them still on the ground, in the ground. I put all of the things on
the ground and then my basement was the only place left in the
ground without all of my friends. Junior Prom got moved to my
basement and it smelled terrible and everyone blamed me for having a weird smelling basement. The smell was coming from the
floor and the walls where I put things. I tried to change myself
but I ended up changing everyone else and how they looked with
their arms and heads and basement smells in concrete and the
ground is like my face with all of these bloody holes. I used to
have a lot of dreams where someone poured lava underneath the
front door and it came into my room and started eating away at
the posts of my loft-bed so I was sinking down closer and closer
to the lava and where I couldn’t scream no matter how loud I
needed to be to warn everyone about what was coming and what
I saw in the ground, and what the edges of triangles can do if
you’re not careful or if you are careful in a different sort of way,
following the lines of her body like he did to me. I dreamed I was
sitting naked on a radiator and a fat man and a fat woman were
touching each other in front of me and then they were touching
me and my skin was burning. I dreamed Daffy Duck came down
to hell on a zip line. I was there waiting for someone and because of what I’d done. I never dreamed who I was waiting for
but my mother said I shouldn’t tell anyone what I saw her do and
I shouldn’t tell anyone what my father did to me I dreamed it. I
dreamed I didn’t do what I did in fact it wasn’t a dream I didn’t
do it it was just a dream when I did it was my lifelong dream to
feel that power I have never felt better than that it was the only
time I ever felt anything it was the only time I didn’t want to die
was when I was killing someone else was when I put my spade to
the ground don’t dream it’s over I wanted to hold on to that feeling forever when I was on the ground with everything that was
mine it was a dream fulfilled it was not a dream so good to feel

hooked to the scale
red and black and blue wires, clear tubes
wiring into me
that switch like the one on my mother’s Tiffany lamp you know the type
of switch I mean it could be white or black sometimes brown or other
colors it has a sort of gear which you push around with your thumb and
there’s a screw holding it together, but you don’t think about that
when you’re
pushing it around
you know
put me out
like a light I guess
gearing up the dark?
the briefcase makes this all seem so
official is that tube supposed to be connecting to something?
it’s almost too long
and okay where do those go

a needle too, wrapped in
plastic do I have to unwrap that when I said a pump before
I meant one

I should take my blood pressure, maybe
that’s important
I’ll check that out later I don’t
trust the computer
funny
the briefcase’s open and the computer’s open
they’ve got black inside tops
it’s almost like I should be confused
whether the bulb is the key
or the keys are
well that’s good because I am. There’s a
white crank on the tube-end of the syringe tube should I
crank it?
looks like a valve— should I crank it?
Do I put the needle there? I

drafting down the long hallways
finding me among the rot
	
the peeling
	
the soft ground, the water ground
I can’t not see the shape of decay
in shadows
burnt behind my eyes
how quickly cities become soft
stuck elevators and rooms full of ceiling
staircases blocked by carpets and chairs, all piled
eternally damp
The towers
watching Liberty
waiting to fall
broken and crooked at the joints
desecrated monuments to a world increasingly buried
haunting my night
Everything is a pile
	
soft
everything is a question
		 with my foot through the roof
		 with my dust-breath
		 with a gut-bucket kicked over

to tee off
to eat up

The best and most dangerous thing about
the Internet is the uniformity of access. As a vessel for information of all media, it is fully impartial
in its delivery, no matter the context, medium, or
message. As content on the web is inherently nonhierarchical, the navigator is able to curate his or
her own experience. It is the individual user who
arrives at one site by leaving another, who at any
moment can make an infinite number of choices
about where to go next and how to get there. It is a
space of constant tension between what one wants
to see and what one is seeing, a controlled bombardment. The user, the code, and whatever puppeteerminds lurk on the other side of the cybercurtain all
coalesce to shape digital experience.
The Internet is also a space of universal authorship. The ability to “retweet,” “repost,” “share,”
or “like” content created by anyone, anywhere in
the world gives the user “ownership” over his or her
landless cyber-territory, if only for an instant.
Though it is conceptually terrifying, we
make impressive use of the Internet. We make it
work for us. This tool for productivity can, however, quickly become any number of other things,
whether we direct it to or not. When you are checking your email, emailing your mom a picture of
your dog, it only takes a few clicks to lead yourself
astray. You are, at any point, the same few seconds
from watching videos of pitbulls dressed as unicorns
as you are from watching videos of men dressed as
unicorns fucking each other. You can even watch
both of those at the same time.
In the putting this project together, I exposed myself to an immense amount of varied material on the Internet, but I was also presented with
material for which I did not go looking. Pop-up windows proliferate unprompted, burying their content
behind and between our work- and play-spaces,
designed to hide from their own rapid, inevitable
death. In this project I indulge those incorporeal
technological forces to the best of my ability.
I spend hours of every day on the Internet,
using it for everything from mere communication
to mental and sexual stimulation. Every user creates a private world for him or herself in this public,
formless place. Over the course of assembling this
collection, I found myself entering areas of the Internet that I would otherwise never have visited vol-

94

untarily, places I did not wish ever to return. But my
relationship to unsavory content changed as I began
to work with it rather than in response to it. I learned
a lot about myself and what I am interested in when
I have access to anything. Whether these interests
were latent within me or entered my being as I arrived at their digital probes is impossible to say.
I was desensitized by this experience in
terms of my threshold for graphic and disturbing
material, but it was also a deeply personal and introspective process. What I would have once found
automatically repulsive became first mesmerizing,
then almost dull. In trolling the web for content to
appropriate and write about for this project I found
myself unfazed by the hours I spent reading murder stories and studying photographs of eviscerated
women for points of particular interest; this satanic
ritual, that recurring pattern of dismemberment, etc.
I knowingly followed a link to a video of a man
testing his new Kevlar vest by shooting himself
in the stomach with a pistol at point blank range.
Rather than slamming closed my laptop’s screen
in horror at his doubled over, stomach-clutching
moan-screams, my interest was piqued. I watched
the whole thing.
And then, seconds later, I emailed You. Or I
emailed You and I blind-copied everyone You went
to elementary school with and they all posted about
You on facebook. Or I emailed You while masturbating. I can do everything at the same time, I
can see anything I want, and no one has to know
about it. I am as anonymous as I want to be; I can
have casual sex tonight. I can invent an experience for myself that is terrifying and loving, funny
and destructive and sexual all at the same time.
It’s as real, for me, as I want it to be, because I am
both the designer and the consumer of this reality.
	
I have attempted in this project to document
my experience on the Internet, but I’ve also manipulated that experience, aestheticized and organized
it toward a particular end. Everything in here is real,
but it is also fabricated. I do not endeavor in this
project to capture the spirit of the whole Internet,
though I am speaking to the universal digital experience. Though all of the material may seem masturbatory or estranged, it is my attempt to locate what
personal “real” can exist within the thick tissue of
virtual seduction.
