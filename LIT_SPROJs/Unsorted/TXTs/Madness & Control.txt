Meanings of Insanity
Insanity can take on a plethora of meanings according to different perspectives in
a multitude of cultures and time periods. This is largely due to the fact that insanity,
madness, unreason and mental disorders are all terms based loosely on a societal
definition. There is no objective way to define what is sane or normal when these
concepts are based completely on the dynamically shifting social constructs of a society.
Therefore the meaning of madness may only be defined subjectively. Although subjective
definitions can suffice for some emotions such as happiness and sadness, there became a
need for an objective definition of insanity. This ideation first became evident with the
introduction of the “General Hospital” in Paris. In 1656, by royal decree, facilities were
created to house those who could not care for themselves and madness began to be seen
as a form of illness in the sense that it was treatable and controllable.
The ramifications of this conception, that the mad were living in some “incorrect”
manner and could be treated, manifested itself with the introduction of hospitals,
physiatrists, and eventually pharmaceutical companies. These institutional forces would
induce an epidemic of mental illness.
In The History of Madness Michael Foucault examines the institutionalization of
madness and mental illness and explains that the General Hospital had a drastically
different use:

!

The directors were also to appoint a physician, who would
be paid an annual fee of one thousand pounds, and who was
to reside at La Pitié and carry out visits to each hospital
house twice a week. One Fact is immediately clear: the
Hôpital Général was not a medical establishment. It was
more of a semi-judicial structure, an administrative entity
that was granted powers to deliberate, judge and pass
sentence independently of other pre-existing authorities and
courts. (Foucault 49)

In order to evaluate how psychiatric institutions constructed the concept of
madness, it necessary to use literary evidence alongside scientific evidence. Although
literature is a form of analysis that is best used in conjunction with other literary works, it
can prove effective in the critique of psychiatric treatment as well as portraying a
humanistic account of mental illness that does not rely on quantifiable phenomena. It can
be said that literary analysis and empirical analysis may differ on many levels, so many
that they cannot be applied mutually. M.E. Grenander, argues differently in her essay,
“Of Greater Import than History: Psychiatry in Fiction”, that “’Fiction writers, or ‘poets’,
as Aristotle pointed out, are bound only by considerations as to "what such or such a kind
of man will probably or necessarily say or do’; it is this limited but precise constraint that
makes their statements "of the nature rather of universals, whereas those of history are
singulars’” (Grenander 29). Grenander refers to a quote by Aristotle in which he views
!

S!

poetry’s importance to be equal, if not superior to historical analysis. This is because of
poetry’s ascription of the esoteric nature of all things, whereas history is meant to be
singular in nature. Grenander asserts that writers are limited by their aims to achieve the
perspective of the average man in order to communicate their ideas. This limitation is
also of great importance because the work is built on the nature of humanity in its search
for authenticity.!
Grenander argues that by involving the behavioral sciences in the term history,
“we recognize that a fruitful field for critical exploration from this point of view is
precisely those areas of human concern in which the behavioral sciences have vested
benefits, but which literary artists have examined more disinterestedly, and hence more
"truthfully", than professional practitioners” (Grenander 29). Here Grenander implies
that literary criticism can serve a purpose of indisputable importance by examining
‘History’, or more specifically in this essay, the behavioral sciences, from a point of view
that is unbiased by ulterior motives. Following an empirical system, the Behavioral
Sciences justify themselves solely for the continued proliferation of its own existence.
From this point of view, Grenander attempts to use literature in order to show the
flaws and social control mechanisms of psychiatry.
Almost without exception, studies of psychiatric practices
by the behavioral sciences adopt the viewpoint of those
who are in a position to use them for social control. Fiction,
however, also gives us an analysis of these practices from
the point of view of those who are susceptible to such
control. As an extension of artists, since they have no
professional commitment to established psychiatric mores,
are paradoxically in a unique position to give us an
objective analysis of their universal human significance,
regardless of the fact that their examination is cast in a
fictional framework (Grenander 29).

+.*1-048!]Psychiatry, as interpreted by its professional adherents, is an instrument of
social control unbridled in its arbitrary grasp of power. Feeding upon its own successes, it
grows constantly more rapacious, its fires stoked by society's yearning for scapegoats and
man's lust for dominion over his fellows” (Grenander 43). Judging from the statistics,
more people are turning to psychiatry in order to receive treatment for their mental
illnesses, giving the psychiatric institution more power. The question may be asked, what
is there to gain from this overwhelming power? Besides the obvious gain of money and
scientific validity in the profession of psychiatry, the institution is creating, possibly
unintentionally, the genocide of the ‘feebleminded’ and ‘completely, hopelessly
defective’ individuals who put their well-being into the hands of the psychiatric
institution. Psychiatrists should realize that through their methods, mental illness is being
created and growing at an exponential rate, creating those who are hopelessly defective.
The result of this is a cycle in which the mentally ill are only pulled deeper into madness
as long as their treatment continues.
I’ve finally realized what is happening. It is our last fling.
We are doomed henceforth. Must screw our courage to the
sticking point and face up to our impending fate. We shall
all of us be shot at dawn. One hundred cc’s apiece. Miss
Ratched shall line us all against the wall, where we’ll face
the terrible maw of muzzle loading shotguns, which she has
loaded with Miltowns! Thorazines! Libriums! Stelazines!
And with a wave of her sword, blooie! Tranquilize all of us
completely out of existence. (Kesey 291)
Kesey illustrates the hopeless situation of the patients through the acutes, who recognize
the deeper motivations of their treatment. They acknowledge the ill intentions behind the
‘medical’ façade that the hospital uses to control them and for better or worse suffer the
awareness that they are being destroyed.

Chapter 4
Crafting Bipolar Disorder
Bi-polar disorder (also known as Manic-depressive disorder) is another ailment
that constitutes the general conception of the ‘madman’. It is a mental illness that causes
an individual to cycle through periods of depression and elation. The manic symptoms
are characterized by the DSM as having such symptoms as a long period of feeling
‘high’, or an overly happy or outgoing mood, extreme irritable mood, agitation, feeling
‘jumpy’ or ‘wired’, talking very fast, jumping from one idea to another, having racing
thoughts. The depressive symptoms of bi-polar disorder are a long period of feeling
worried or empty, loss of interest in activities once enjoyed, including sex, feeling tired
or ‘slowed down’, having problems concentrating and sleeping, and thinking of death or
suicide, or attempting suicide.
Bi-polar disorder, in the past was held as a relatively rare disease; however, after
the arrival of Lithium, the main treatment for bi-polar disorder, the illness exploded in
popularity in America. “In an era prior to pharmacotherapy, poor outcome in mania was
considered to be a relatively rare occurrence,’ Zarate and Tohen wrote. ‘However,
modern outcome studies have found that a majority of bi-polar patients evidence high
rates of functional impairment” (Whitaker 188). It is shown that before the lithium days
of Bi-polar disorder, recovery rates were extremely high, and functional impairment and
relapse were rare occurrences, “In the pre-lithium era, 85 percent of mania patients would
return to work or to their ‘pre-morbid’ social role. As Winokur wrote in 1969 most
patients had ‘no difficulty resuming their usual occupations.’ But then Bi-polar patients
began cycling through emergency rooms more frequently, employment rates began to
decline, and soon investigators were reporting fewer than half of all bi-polar patients
were employed or otherwise ‘functionally recovered’” (Whitaker 189). The rates of bipolar recovery began to plummet from the 85 percent of recovery rate to less than 50
percent. This statistic only fell with time, dropping to 24 percent recovery rates in 1995”
(Whitaker 189). Aside from the staggering drop in recovery rates, the total admission of
bi-polar patients has also dramatically increased, “Today, according to the NIMH
[National Institute of Mental Health], bi-polar illness affects one in every forty adults in
the United States” (Whitaker 179). Clearly, something was amiss in the treatment of

bipolar disorder, specifically, in the initial treatment for depression, which led to the
diagnosis of bipolar disorder.
To begin, it is necessary to look into the proposed and accepted cause of
depression,
For years the dominant biological theory of depression, like
the dopamine neurotransmitter theory of schizophrenia,
was derived from speculations on how and why
medications sometimes seem to alleviate depression. One
of the earlier groups of antidepressants, the monoamine
oxidase inhibitors (MAOIs) such as parnate, marplan, and
nardil – tends to increase the levels of available
norepiniphrine [A neurotransmitter] in the central nervous
system. So it was hypothesized that depression might result
from the opposite – too little norepinephrine, Later studies
showed that some so-called antidepressants also cause
increase in the availability of another neurotransmitter,
serotonin. So the theory was enlarged: some forms of
depression may be due to too little serotonin as well as too
much. (Breggin 141)

The narrator of Invisible Man relates his experience with
electroshock (pp. 177-183). My head was encircled by a
piece of cold metal like the iron cap worn by the occupant
of an electric chair. [. . .] The machine droned, and I [. . .]
steeled myself for the shocks, but was blasted nevertheless.
The pulse came swift and staccato, increasing gradually
until I fairly danced between the nodes. My teeth chattered.
1 closed my eyes and bit my lips to smother my screams.
Warm blood filled my mouth [. . .]. I wanted to be angry,
murderously angry. But somehow the pulse of current
smashing through my body prevented me. Something had
been disconnected . . .. I tried to imagine myself angry –
only to discover a deeper sense of remoteness. I was
beyond anger. I was only bewildered. [...] There was no
avoiding the shock and I rolled with the agitated tide, out
into the blackness [. . .]. All my limbs seemed amputated [.

. .]. I seemed to have lost all sense of proportion. [...].
Thoughts evaded me, hiding in the vast stretch of clinical
whiteness, which I seemed connected only by a scale o f
receding grays. [...] I seemed to exist in some other
dimension, utterly alone. [...]. Meanings were lost in the
vast whiteness in which myself was lost. [...] A terrible
sense of loneliness came over me. When he [the invisible
man] is asked his name, he cannot remember it: "I was
overcome with swift shame. I realized that I no longer
knew my own name. [...] I tried again, plunging into the
blackness of my mind. It was no use; I found nothing but
pain. [...] Who am I? I asked myself. (Grenander 40)
The protagonist in the Invisible man describes the process of electroshock therapy to be
extremely traumatizing. This is clear from the imagery of warm blood filling the mouth,
as well as the feeling that all of his limbs had been amputated. After this seemingly long
process of pain and torture, the effects were clear; the Invisible Man had lost his entire
identity to the brain damaging process of shock therapy. Although this is a fictional
account of electro shock therapy, it proves to be more accurate than the scientific claims
“that the animal research showed no damage. To the dismay of those of us who
independently read the original investigations, most animal studies turned out to provide
unequivocal proof of brain damage” (Breggin 197). Despite the scientific proof that ECT
caused brain damage, the psychiatric institution still supported it as a miracle cure. “The
treatment is relatively harmless and that its method of action is unknown” (Breggin 198).
The absurdity that electroshock therapy caused no brain damage in animals was an
unrealistic statement, as EST or ECT is in itself, a damaging process; “Many shock
authorities boldly declared that the treatment works precisely by damaging the brain and
that brain-cell death is the key to successful treatment” (Breggin 198). The result of this
intentional brain damage is accurately described in the quote from the Invisible Man.
What results is a complete reprogramming of personality, causing patients to lose sight of
themselves.
The invisible man’s traumatic account of shock therapy cannot merely be ascribed
as fiction. The loss of identity was common in shock therapy, and was occasionally even
the intention. “H.C. Tien, a Michigan psychiatrist who founded an earlier organization,
the American Society for Electrotherapy, would draw media attention in the late 1970s
!

RY!

and early 1980s after [Peter Breggin] publicized his use of shock to obliterate and
reprogram the mind of a woman to make her a more suitable housewife” (Breggin 190).
Shock therapy works by damaging the brain so one may be able to reprogram a
depressive or mentally ill individual to be a different person entirely. In the case study
mentioned above by Peter Breggin, this process is outlined more clearly:
Tien, a self-styled ‘family psychiatrist,’ purposely used the
older methods of shock to ‘maximize memory loss – and
for a very good reason,’ which was to eradicate the
women’s identity or personality in order reprogram it. Tien
believes that the ‘memory loosening’ and the ‘infantile’
state produced by electroshock make the patient amenable
to drastic change. A relative helps reprogram the patient’s
personality according to a ‘blueprint’ worked out prior to
the shock. Verbatim dialogues with Tien and a married
couple dramatize how the wife believes, before her shock
treatment, that she wants to leave her husband. She doesn’t
love him, he is never home, and he beats her in front of the
children. Under threat that her husband would try to get
custody of the children in a divorce, the wife, Peggy, agrees
to undergo the treatment. After each ECT Peggy regresses
to a childlike state and is ‘reprogrammed’ by her bottlefeeding husband to believe that her past personality was
bad and that her new one is ‘good’. She assumes a new
name, Belinda, to signify the change. Incidentally, Tien
tells us, she became ‘paranoid’ during the first treatment,
accusing those around her of harming her; but then she
submitted to a second series of shock. (Breggin 201)
The workings of H.C. Tien resemble that of a science fiction villain who pushes the
limits of morality and human control. Utilizing the effects of ECT to its frightening
potential, Tien is able to create personalities that resemble that of a mail order wife
scheme, changing Peggy into Belinda by using the child-like, traumatized state that
occurs directly after ECT to forcibly brainwash Peggy into internalizing chosen traits and
ideas. “Tien calls his method ELT, explaining that E is for electricity, L is for Love, and
T is for therapy” (Breggin 201). Tien, as though unaware of the ethical repercussions,
asserted that his method utilized therapy and love as well as electricity.
The treatment given to McMurphy resembles this totalitarian use of ECT.

of the treatments, but he just laughed and told me Hell, all
they was doin’ was chargin’ his battery for him, free for
nothing […] He insisted it wasn’t hurting him. He wouldn’t
even take his capsules. But every time that loudspeaker
called for him to forgo his breakfast and prepare to walk to
Building One, the muscles in his jaw went taut and his
whole face drained of color, looking thin and scared […] I
had a lot of things I wanted to say to him before I went, but
he’s just come back from a treatment and was sitting
following the ping pong ball with his eye like he was wired
to it. (Kesey 277)
At first his stubborn will to resist the authority of the hospital kept him sane and able to
speak for himself yet as the treatment progressed, his will and ability to fight the system
had been damaged. After each session he would merely sit and stare out into space. This
is the reality of shock therapy. There is no evidence that it treats depression, nor is it in
any way beneficial to the patient, it merely chips away at a patient’s ability to feel
depressed, until it eventually destroys the patient’s ability to feel anything, much like a
lobotomized patient. ECT destroys our ability to be ourselves and brings us deeper under
the control of the institutions that support it.
The quantifiable effects of ECT are characterized by mental deterioration resulting
in “debilitating problems, such as memory difficulties, deficiencies in focusing and
maintaining concentration, and a loss of problem solving skills” (Breggin 197). The
desirable effects of ECT are achieved from the repeated brain damage and mass cell
death. “The shock works by damaging the brain and by making patients more
simpleminded, less self aware, and docile” (Breggin 199). It made patients easier to
control and contain within the psychiatric institute by making the patient completely
submissive and easily manipulated. They saw it as a form of drastic punishment, a
punishment that was so effective that the more it was exercised, the less the patient would
be able to carry out actions that deserved punishment. “In one case the psychiatrist told
the husband of a patient that the treatment would help his wife by virtue of its effect as a
‘mental spanking’… ‘Clearly the main attitudes expressed are those of hostility and
punishment’ in regard to giving electroshock…. Abse and Ewing also document the use
of shock as a threat against difficult patients. Personnel on the hospital wards would
warn, ‘You will go on the shock list’’’ (Breggin 212). Not only was shock so effective at
!

R[!

creating submissive patients from brain damage, but also it was used as a sadistic
punishment to those who are ‘difficult’ or ‘unresponsive’ to treatments. Just as in
McMurphy’s case, shock treatment was used to dissolve the patient’s will and ability to
speak out against their treatments and effectively quieted any questioning of authority in
the hospital, keeping all those who were reliant on that system to be completely under
their control.
The question is asked, why psychiatrists would continue using and supporting such
a drastic and mutilating process? The answer stems from the same motivation the
psychiatrists have for prescribing life-long medications, money.
We can easily calculate the annual income a psychiatrist
can generate by shocking an average of only five patients a
week at a typical charge of $200 per treatment. Since he
will shock each patient three times a week, he will do
fifteen shock treatments each week. At that rate he will
earn 150,000 a year. The time invested by the shock doctor
will hardly impinge on the rest of his week. Since each
treatment takes only a few minutes, the doctor can easily do
five in an hour, so it will take him a mere three hours per
week to earn his annual income of 150,000. If the shock
doctor also visits his patients on the ward, he can make
much more money. Hospital consultants, sometimes lasting
only a few minutes, will be covered by insurance at a
higher rate than is psychotherapy in a private office. If the
psychiatrist sees each of his five shock patients three times
a week at $150 per consultation, he can generate an
additional $112,500, for a grand total of 262,500 a year,
without using up more than a few hours’ time. Such
enormous financial incentives can wholly cloud the
doctor’s perception of whether or not shock is good for the
patient. It’s too good for the doctor. (Breggin 191)
The financial benefits of ECT prove to be a powerful force behind the decades of
continuous support from top psychiatrists, claiming ECT holds great benefit for many
patients, when in reality shock therapy can only be heralded as ‘mental spanking’ for
reluctant adults.
Shock therapy is still widely used in state mental hospitals to treat the mentally ill;
its prevalence has only grown over time despite the negative reviews. One may think that
the procedure of shock therapy had been generally softened to conform to the ethical
!

RV!

standards of treating patients; however the opposite is true. “There is no reason to believe
that modern shock is safer. The electrical stimulation must, in fact, be stronger nowadays,
since the patients are sedated, and sedation makes it more difficult to convulse the
patients” (Breggin 197). Today shock therapy is generally exercised at even higher
voltages to account for the medications that act on the patient. Perhaps the most appalling
revelation concerning ECT is that outside of mental hospitals, elderly females are the
most common shocked. “In 1977 only 28.7 percent of all patients were age sixty-five or
older, but by 1983 it had leaped to 43.1 percent, and finally to 53.1 percent in 1988. This
means those elderly women are among the most frequent victims of shock treatment […]
Frail, despairing, desperately needing emotional support, elderly women often have no
one to defend or stand up for them, and they are unlikely to find the strength in
themselves to defy their doctors” (Breggin 193). Due to the submissiveness of elderly
women, they are often coaxed into shock treatment by a psychiatrist’s reassurance that it
is harmless, painless and will help cure symptoms of depression almost instantly. This is
totally false: “The truth is while antidepressants are especially dangerous to older people,
and so is electroshock. Reports are coming in that the elderly are far more sensitive to
shock’s damaging effects, including brain damage and dysfunction” (Breggin 193).
Shock treatment is often prescribed to the elderly because of the high risk of taking
antidepressants even though the risks of undergoing shock therapy are just as dangerous
and the older brain is more prone to cell death and damage. Psychiatrists take advantage
of the large elderly demographic, who are seeking relief from depression and are met
with permanent brain damage and an escalating medical bill.

Chapter 5
The Psychospiritual Crisis
After looking into the two main illnesses that are synonymous with the ‘madman
’in modern day thinking, one can see nearly all the symptoms of schizophrenia and
bipolar disorder. These symptoms include hallucinations, delusions, paranoia, dramatic
mood swings and general inability to speak coherently. The other stereotypical traits of
the insane being physical tics, aggressive behavior and mental deterioration can be shown
to be symptoms of the treatment designed to ‘cure’ madness. Taking this into
consideration, many of the socially impairing symptoms of madness are created through
the efforts of treatment. One may ask, is there any way of treating mental illness without
the drastic side effects, as well as the trauma of being treated through psychiatric
procedures? The answer lies in the “Psychospiritual” crisis of those exhibiting mental
illness. Coined by writer Anton Boisen, Psychospiritual crisis are the products of the
internal struggles that each individual must go through, in order to establish a sense of
identity. The results of this struggle leads to the traits of insanity that are apparent in
Schizophrenia and Bipolar disorder. “For the person in a Psychospiritual crisis,
‘Philosophy and theology are no longer theoretical and abstract problems. They are
matters of life and death. These ‘psychotic’ episodes are radical explorations of solutions
to severe identity threats: ‘the sufferer is facing what for him are the great and abiding
issues of life and death and of his own relationship to the universe. ” (Breggin 29).
Psychospiritual crises are characterized by an internal struggle to find an acceptable
answer for the deeper meanings of life, a struggle that every great philosopher or writer
must undergo in order to gain perspective on their ideas, as well as the personal validity
of one’s ideals. “In The Politics of Experience (1967), psychiatrist R.D. Laing gave
madness a ringing endorsement and heaped criticism on organized psychiatry. According
to Laing, ‘schizophrenics’ have more to teach psychiatrists about the inner world than
psychiatrists their patients.’ To paraphrase him: the mad are inarticulate poets;
psychiatrists are articulate know-nothings” (Breggin 31). Laing asserts that psychiatrists,
who lack any sort of critical thought allowing a sense of morality, have no understanding
of the inner mental toils of the self-aware individual. The schizophrenic that suffers from
an intensified sense of self-awareness requires a full grasp of their beliefs about the world

!

Y\!

around them. This misunderstanding is the key to clarifying why psychiatrists attempt to
replace all forms of rumination, depression, and inspiration with tranquility and ‘happy
thoughts’.
Mad persons are victims of a corrupt upbringing: ‘behavior
that gets labeled schizophrenic is a special strategy that a
person invented in order to live in an unlivable situation.
What’s wrong is not ‘in the patient,’ but in the family and
in society. The problem is also in the psychiatrist, who
diagnoses and treats the patient, thereby increasing his or
her confusion and self-doubt. If guided by kindness and
understanding the schizophrenic experience could become
a transcendental journey of death and rebirth toward a new,
more positive meaning in life: ‘Madness need not be all
breakdown. It may also be breakthrough. It is potential
liberation and renewal as well as enslavement and
existential death. (Breggin 31)
The theory of Psychospirituality is pushed further by claiming that madness is caused by
traumatic upbringing, having to do either with the family or society as a whole. This
theory, which very closely follows the Freudian school of thought on a fundamental
level, proposes madness to be a naturally occurring reaction to an undesirable living
situation. In other words, when the external factors of life are painful and traumatic, the
individual turns to the internal world where they may question reality and also
themselves. This leads to the common trait of insanity in which the madman confuses his
dream world of conflicting inner ideas with the reality that he strives to avoid. Treating
madness from the psychospiritual perspective is impossible alongside psychiatric
treatment. “Antipsychotic drugs and electroshock may prove too drastic a handicap, as
psychological helplessness is compounded by brain dysfunction” (Breggin 31). The
longer a patient is committed to a psychiatric institution, the more difficult it is to combat
their Psychospiritual crisis. This is because any form of deep emotion or thought is
intentionally and effectively destroyed in the image of the psychiatric model of no
thoughts, no mental illness. The discord between the Psychospiritual approaches and
pharmaceutical approaches to madness is no coincidence. Psychiatry’s main goal during
the 1950s was to destroy any theory-based method of treating the mentally ill through the
claim that mental illnesses were biological in origin. “The search for biomedical and

!

YQ!

genetic causes keeps psychiatrists, as medical doctors, in the forefront of well funded
research in the field. The notion that patients have ‘sick brains’ justifies psychiatry’s
claim to the top of the mental health hierarchy. In short, if irrationality isn’t biological,
then psychiatry loses much of its rationale for existence as a medical specialty” (Breggin
23). The manifestation of psychiatry as a medical profession required that all other
methods be discredited. The theory of Psychospirituality was buried along with other
theories that speculated mental illness to be caused by profound inner turmoil rather than
chemical imbalance.
Looking further into the theory of Psychospiritual crisis, specifically in Kesey’s
Chief Bromden, one can make sense of the irrational thoughts that circulate in his head
by understanding the metaphorical meanings of his hallucinations and delusions.
A large indicator of metaphorical meaning in Chief Bromden’s delusions is the
recurring fog hallucination. “I know how they work it, the fog machine. We had a whole
platoon used to operate fog machines around airfields overseas. Whenever intelligence
figured there might be a bombing attack, or if the generals had something secret they
wanted to pull – out of sight, hid so good that even the spies of the base couldn’t see what
went on – they fogged the field” (Kesey 124). Bromden reveals the significance behind
his fog hallucination to be a symptom of Post Traumatic Stress Disorder from
participating in the Vietnam War. He explains that during his service, his platoon would
use a fog machine to hide from the enemy: “You were safe from the enemy, but you were
awfully alone. Sounds died and dissolved after a few yards, and you couldn’t hear any of
the rest of your crew… other than that brown shirt and brass buckle, you couldn’t see
nothing but white, like from the waist down you were being dissolved by the fog” (Kesey
125). Bromden describes the sensation of being enveloped in fog as being a safe place,
where the enemy can’t find you, but as a result, you would begin to lose yourself as well.
“When a man showed up you didn’t want to look at his face and he didn’t wanted to look
at yours, because it’s painful to see somebody so clear that it’s like looking inside of him,
but then neither did you want to look away and lose him completely. You had a choice:
you could either strain and look at things that appeared in front of you in the fog, as
painful as it might be, or you could relax and lose yourself” (Kesey 125). Confrontation
in the fog proved to be very disturbing, as the fog seemed to make the other person

!

YW!

appear so clearly that it was almost as if you could see inside them. One must put forth
the effort to keep a grasp on one’s external surroundings in the fog, or succumb to its
dissolving nature, losing your identity in the comfort of feeling safe.
The pivotal clue in revealing the significance of the fog is revealed in Bromden’s
monologue concerning McMurphy’s lack of submission to the fog. “Nobody complains
at all about the fog. I know why, now: as bad as it is, you can slip back in it and feel safe.
That’s what McMurphy can’t understand, us wanting to be safe. He keeps trying to drag
us out of the fog, out in the open where we’d be easier to get at” (Kesey 123). The fog is
revealed to be closely connected to the control tactics used at the Hospital. When “in the
fog”, one is conforming to the control tactics of the hospital by being submissive and
showing no signs of reluctance. The safety of the fog is also conducive to the dulling
aspects of the medications that the patients take daily which causes a loss of identity and
in turn a comfort within the depersonalizing “soft whiteness” of the fog. This refers to the
medical sterilization of adverse thoughts and character through sedation. McMurphy tries
to ‘drag everyone out of the fog’ by attempting to fight back against Nurse Ratched and,
in essence, psychiatric treatment. This causes him to become “visible” to the enemy, who
attempt to eradicate any resistance to the control tactics in use. This is evident during the
long period of time when Chief Bromden pretended to be a deaf mute, the epitome of
what the institution strives to achieve in all their patients. This is when he is safest from
the controlling tendencies of the hospital officials. “I don’t fight or make noise. If you
yell it’s just tougher on you. I hold back on the yelling. I hold back till they get to my
temples [...] Then I can’t hold back. It’s not a will-power thing anymore when they get to
my temples. It’s a button, pushed, says Air Raid Air Raid, and turns me on so loud it’s
like no sound. They start the fog machine again and it’s snowing down cold and white all
over me like skim milk, so thick that I might have been able to hide in it if they didn’t
have a hold on me” (Kesey 7). With the fog comes the temptation of becoming invisible
to the enemy, alleviating Bromden’s suffering by obscuring his desire to fight against the
treatment.
The fog disappears later on in the novel when Bromden is revealed to have been
faking being deaf and mute. “There’s no more fog any place. All of a sudden I remember
I’m supposed to clean the staff room during these meetings they have, been doing it for

!

YX!

years. But now I’m too scared to get out of my chair. The staff always let me clean the
room because they didn’t think I could hear, but now that they saw me lift my hand when
McMurphy told me to, won’t they know I can hear” (Kesey 141). The possibility of
hiding in the fog had been destroyed for Bromden. He had exposed himself acting against
Ratched’s authority, no longer able to hide in his charade that he was unable to speak or
hear. This newly formed situation is frightening for Bromden as it was his tendency to
hide that kept him safe from the more drastic methods of control set aside for those who
chose to step out of the fog. Coincidentally, after the “growing lessons” from McMurphy,
Bromden decides to forever leave the fog after his experience with shock therapy. “How
many hours have I been out? It’s fogging a little, but I won’t slip off and hide in it. No …
never again … I stood up slowly, feeling numb between the shoulders […] I couldn’t
remember all of it yet, but I rubbed my eyes with the heels of my hands and tried to clear
my head. I worked at it. I’d never worked at coming out of it before” (Kesey 279). This
breakthrough moment for Bromden is illustrated as the desire to never hide in the fog
again. Instead of losing himself to the depersonalizing effects of drugs and submission,
He decides to fight back against the temptation of the fog and to clear his mind for the
first time. This was a decision, which eventually leads to his choice to escape the
hospital, but not before putting an end to the empty husk that was McMurphy. The
psychospiritual crisis was solved thanks to the McMurphy’s therapy. By re-learning how
to think for himself, confidently, Bromden was able to escape the fog and grow back to
his normal size. If it were not for this, Bromden would have never attempted to fight the
fog and would have lived out the rest of his days as a silent acute.
Bromden, as well as other mentally ill patients often speak in metaphorical ways
that are hard at first to understand. In this case Bromden relates his diminished selfconfidence to the physical phenomena of shrinking. Actual mental patients exhibit this
characteristic; as the hallucinations and delusions are usually rooted in rationality, though
branch outward, irrationally. Breggin shows this through the description of a relapse
patient at the hospital where he worked.
‘Can’t you see them?’ She retorted with irritation. ‘Them?’
‘The worms.’ Mrs. Merr cringed when I reached out to
touch her where she saw creepy crawly things on her skin.
Then I patted her, communicating that I neither saw nor felt

!

YR!

anything awful coming out of her body. I also talked to
others about how bad she must feel about herself that she
imagined such awful things from inside her. […] In the
morning I presented her case for evaluation by a senior
psychiatrist, who happened to recall her from a previous
admission. ‘She won’t need shock therapy this time,’ he
announced after interviewing her. ‘She’s got no
hallucinations or delusions, and she’s eating and drinking
fluids. She’s not nearly as sick on this admission as she was
two years ago.’ I tried to explain that she had arrived in at
least as bad a condition as the previous time and had
responded well to several hours of attention, but the senior
psychiatrist couldn’t believe it. After all, no one in the
hospital had ever tried to help people like Mrs. Merr ‘by
just talking to them,’ it made no sense to him. Of course, I
didn’t ‘cure’ Mrs. Merr. I’m sure I hardly dented her vast
problems. But I was able to get her through her crisis
without further damaging her brain. (Breggin 134)
Just through the simple conversation held with Mrs. Merr, Breggin was able to get
through her hallucinations and delusions, successfully convincing her to eat. By not
simply checking off a list of symptoms and prescribing the ‘proper’ treatment, he was
able to get Mrs. Merr through her episode without having to resort to such measures as
shock treatment. The metaphorical significance of the worms coming out of her skin was
a manifestation of the negative feelings she held of herself. The simple communication
was not enough to forever solve Mrs. Merr’s mental illness, yet it was sufficient in
helping the patient through an episode without resorting to drastic measures resulting in
further harm.
Mental illness can be categorized and quantified in the DSM as a biological
disease with medical treatments that primarily involve drugs. The treatments that have
been proposed and ‘proved’ to be effective cannot be taken too seriously. Medical
psychiatry has turned mental illnesses into a self-perpetuating epidemic, affecting the
entire population of the United States in the interest of financial gain and power. This is a
testament to the corruption that large corporations fall victim to. In the interest of
establishing itself as the fundamental power in treating the mentally ill, the psychiatric
institution has created a paradox in which non-medicated individuals are suffering from
symptoms of being un-medicated. Those who are on the chemical cocktail find
!

YY!

themselves desperately dependent on them, due to worsening symptoms of existing
mental illnesses and the onset of iatrogenic ones. The push for bio-psychiatry has proven
to be a powerful force in the attention of the public, who have accepted the biological and
genetic theories put forth by scientific publication and the media. As psychiatrists come
to realize their relatively newfound jurisdiction to treat the mentally ill, even against their
will, they falsely promote drugs as having little to no long term effects. By doing this
they take advantage of those who seek help by promoting profitable treatments.
The epidemic has continued to grow, along with popularity of pharmaceutical
treatments. As long as the institution of psychiatry goes on unchallenged, the mentally ill
will continue to be controlled and subdued in order to promote the philosophy that favors
the destruction of thought over the formation of social identity. The epidemic of
increasing mental illness rates, coupled with dropping recovery rates, will continue until
eventually no form of spirituality or identity will exist. Those with enough substance to
have psychospiritual crisis will eventually become extinct without so much as a look
back.

Conclusion
Overview
Mental Illness has always been on the forefront of thought, acting as an antithesis
to the movement of reason. People lived side by side with those who were deemed insane
or mad, as it was considered a part of life to experience and/or witness madness. This all
changed in the wake of the General Hospital, which began its career as a mass grave for
Lepers, who were all gathered and shipped to these hospitals in an effort to get rid of the
disease all together. After this successful genocide, the General Hospital began to be
filled with social deviants and political radicals who posed a threat to the philosophy of
the government; they did this by accusing them of exhibiting unreason. These individuals
were deemed insane and were kept hidden from society. This was the beginning of a
second attempt at genocide, this time aimed at those who ran at odds with the
governmental and domestic systems of the state. This was the pivotal moment in which
man became alienated from his mad counterpart and the definition of madness was
reinvented to signify delinquency rather than a radically different lens of perspective,
turning madness into mentally ill. This misconception of the insane was exacerbated by
their diminished presence and public’s view of the insane became dependent of media
portrayals as well as the social dogma surrounding them.
In turn, this changed the view of insanity to be a form of social delinquency and
introduced the revolutionary new idea that insanity was a social menace and must be
contained and “solved”. The idea that madness had any kind of cure was revolutionary in
itself. These treatments proved to be strong forms of control and were meant to keep the
insane from leaving the hospitals, rather than alleviating their sickness. This began the
complex relationship between madness and control that resulted in the formation of
Psychiatry as an institution, born and nourished from the social control of the mad. In the
beginning madness only needed to be contained, but as time went on the public became
informed that there was an effective remedy to madness, cures were invented out of the
control tactics in use. The chains that tied down each patient were meant, to exhaust the
‘animal spirits’ that inspired madness, rather than to contain and banish them from
existence. This was not only intended to keep the insane in control, they were for the

!

Y[!

purpose of storing the mad away indefinitely. This notion of creating cures out of
mechanisms of control was to be endlessly recycled in the years to come.
Little had changed in the process of securing and controlling the mad until the
introduction of Pinel’s methods of curing madness. Pinel liberated the mad from their
physical incarceration and instead worked for the purpose of mental oppression. He
removed the chains from their ankles, unlocked the prison bars that kept them stagnant
and took off the gags that kept them from shouting. In place of all these physical
constraints, Pinel taught the mad humiliation and shame through his debilitating
therapies. He took the spirit out of each patient by ignoring their irrational claims. Instead
of trying to prove the insane to be incorrect, he taught his staff at the hospitals to prove
the insane correct in order to keep them from shouting their irrationalities to the world.
Pinel made the patient’s madness known to all and attempted to destroy it by making
them ashamed of it. Above all, Pinel introduced the constant aspect of guilt, taking away
the victimized status of the confined, and made those who worked at the hospital the
victims for having to deal with the incessant nonsense of the patients. This was the
beginning of a deeper form of control that would prove to be much more effective at
controlling madness.
The school of Freudian thought began taking precedence all over Europe and
eventually in America. The revolutionary new idea that madness exists in all of us,
manifested in our dreams and neurosis, began to dominate the field of mental illness and
the prevalence of psychiatry began to dwindle. Patients were being moved from
institutions to the private offices of psychoanalysts. This was until the introduction of
Thorazine in the 1950s; the magic pill that cured insanity.
Looking desperately to change the course of psychiatry from a dying profession to
a once again powerful institution, Psychiatry transformed itself into a medical practice by
proposing the chemical imbalance theories of mental illness and promoting the drugs that
supposedly cured them. Thorazine was introduced as a fantastically effective for mental
illness, provided that it was indeed a biological illness that could be cured as simply as
real disease. In reality, much like in the beginning days of psychiatry, the theory was
caused by the proposed cure for madness, a cure that only resulted in the masking of
mental illness through complete tranquilization and submission of the patients. Despite

!

YV!

the lack of scientific evidence behind these “cures” for mental illnesses, the theories were
widely accepted throughout the US, which resulted in the explosion of “miracle pills”
becoming the unanimously accepted treatment to cure all forms of mental illness. The
result of this sudden rise to power of the pharmaceutical companies and psychiatric
institution was the growing rate of all forms of mental illnesses. These were all validated
by the unsupported theories of chemical imbalance to promote the efficacy of the drugs.
Suddenly, rare illnesses that were highly treatable exploded out of control, along with the
creation of iatrogenic illnesses that resulted in additional medications becoming
necessary to combat the side effects of the initial treatment. Patients became hopelessly
dependent on the drugs that had exacerbated their problems in the first place and the
psychiatrists willingly took advantage of the subdued and permanently brain damaged
patients, who no longer had the autonomy to seek change. In the doctor-patient
relationship, the psychiatrist had all the power, being able to treat the patient against
his/her will, being able to diagnose illnesses and prescribe drugs that the mentally ill are
supposed to stay on for presumably the rest of their lives.
Psychiatry spiraled out of control as it remarketed itself annually through the
introductions of newer drugs and newer illnesses. Today this problem runs rampant and
affects “one in every sixteen young adults in the United States” (Whitaker 10). Mental
Illness is no longer a minor, treatable problem, but a major epidemic that is exponentially
creating more power and profit for the psychiatric institution, effectively discouraging
any hope of reform.
Gateways to Madness
Today, the problem only expands as psychiatrists become richer and their methods
become more widely accepted and introduced at younger ages with the introduction of
such illnesses as ADD (Attention Deficit Disorder).
There was no rush by psychiatrists during the 1960s to
prescribe Ritalin to fidgety children who went to regular
schools […] The population of children so hyperactive that
they might be diagnosed with “organic brain dysfunction”
was small. However, psychiatry’s use of Ritalin slowly
began to climb during the 1970s, such that by the end of the
!

Yd!

decade perhaps 150,000 children in the United States were
taking the drug. In 1980, the field published the DSM-III,
and it identified “attention deficit disorder” as a disease for
the first time. The cardinal symptoms were “hyperactivity,”
“inattention,” and “impulsivity,” and given that many
children fidget in their seats and have trouble paying
attention in school, the diagnosis of ADD began to take off
[…] Today, perhaps 3.5 million American children take a
stimulant for ADHD; with the centers for disease reporting
in 2007 that one in every twenty-three children four to
seventeen years old is so medicated. (Whitaker 220)
Just as adults are diagnosed with depression when they experience grief or stress from
everyday life, children are being diagnosed with ADD and ADHD for being energetic,
enthusiastic, and curious. The glaring flaw in diagnosing hyperactive children with ADD
has been questioned as an extreme by few; however, being energetic is a natural trait of
the youth. “Wender is very clear about the crux of the problem in dealing with his
hyperactive youngsters, their failure to comply with requests and prohibitions [...] ‘A
child who cannot force himself to complete tedious disagreeable school tasks will have
trouble mastering reading, spelling and arithmetic” (Breggin 280). Diagnosing children
with ADD in school is absurd because of the monotony of school-life. He also asserts that
children who are not completely obedient to the rules can be diagnosed with ADD in
order to force the child to comply. This is the beginning of a child’s life of obedience and
submission to authority, a state of mind that Stanley Milgram coined as the agentic state.
As soon as the child emerges from the cocoon of the
family, he is transferred to an Institutional System of
Authority, the school. Here, the child learns not merely a
specific curriculum but also how to function within an
organized framework. His actions are, to a significant
degree, regulated by his teachers, but he can perceive that
they in turn subjected to the discipline and requirements of
a headmaster. The student observes that arrogance is not
passively accepted by authority but severely rebuked and
that deference is the only appropriate and comfortable
response to authority. (Milgram 137)
The child, during the school setting begins to learn how to react to authority and
eventually develops the agentic state, or a state in which one relinquishes one’s own
!

S\!

beliefs and morals in acting as an agent to authority. This allows them to alienate their
own actions from their conscience. In this case, from an early age the child learns to
accept the authority of the psychiatrist and begin to view psychiatric medication as a
symbol of health and morality, optimistically creating such personalities as nurse
Ratched. The students who do not initially respond well to authority are forced to fall
under the control of the psychiatric institution. They are led to believe that they are
physically sick and unwell, and the medication is the only thing that can help them. This
resulted in many children being diagnosed with other mental illnesses as a side effect of
ADD medication.
Even before the prescribing of Ritalin took hold, it was
well known that amphetamines could stir psychotic and
manic episodes […] From 2000-2005, the agency had
received nearly one thousand reports of stimulant induced
psychosis and mania in children and adolescents, and given
that these MedWatch reports are thought to represent 1
percent of the actual number of adverse events, this
suggests that 100,000 youths diagnosed with ADHD
suffered psychotic and or manic episodes during a five year
period…Once this drug induced psychosis occurs, the
children are usually diagnosed with bipolar disorder.
Moreover, this diagnostic progression from medicated
ADHD to bipolar illness is well recognized by experts in
the field. (Whitaker 237)
Children who “suffered” naturally” from the effects of ADD and ADHD were prescribed
stimulants which were widely known to induce manic episodes. This frequently resulted
in children, who went from being diagnosed as energetic and unable to concentrate in
school, to being diagnosed with bipolar disorder. This began the never-ending cycle of
prescription pills, which in turn causes the mental illness to spiral out of control from
iatrogenic effects. The epidemic that is the drastic increase in mental illness becomes
illuminated by these facts. As iatrogenic illness grows, so does the rate of juvenile bipolar
disorder as well as the national disability rates. Children who have been told early on that
their illness is genetically and biologically caused live their lives believing that they must
be on medication indefinitely, completely unaware of the actual effects of the drugs.
“Starting in 1990, the number of mentally ill children rose thirty-five fold. Mental illness

!

SQ!

is now the leading cause of disability in children, with the mentally ill group comprising
50 percent of the total number of children on the SSI rolls in 2007.” (Whitaker 8). The
result of this increase in adolescent mental illness are the horror stories we constantly
hear concerning children who are prescribed more and more medications while at the
same time developing more illnesses as a result.
Another gateway into madness that is sweeping the nation at an alarming rate is
the rise of Benzodiazepines, an anti-anxiety medication. The history of Benzodiazepines
begins in the late 1950s along with the introduction of Thorazine, with the drug Miltown.
When Miltown first appeared, there were a number of
studies published in medical journal that told – as two
Harvard medical School researchers, David Greenblatt and
Richard Shader, later recalled – of how ‘it was almost
magically effective in reducing anxiety […] In their review
of the Miltown literature in 1974, Greenblatt and Shader
found that in twenty-six well-controlled trials, there were
only five in which Miltown ‘was more effective than
placebo’ as treatment for anxiety… The initial popularity of
this drug, they wrote, illustrates how factors other than
scientific evidence may determine physicians’ patterns of
drug use. (Whitaker 131)
After initial glowing reviews of Miltown faded and scientific facts began to break down
its reputation as a ‘magic pill’, it was taken out of pharmacies due to the lack of efficacy
as well as its dangerous side effects. This resulted in the remarketing of Miltown through
prescription of drugs with the same effects; however, with different names and potencies.
Today, the most widely prescribed anti-anxiety drug, Xanax, has reached the popularity
of Miltown at its peak. “The prescribing of benzodiazepines in the United States has
increased, from 69 million prescriptions in 2002 to 83 million in 2007” (Whitaker 132).
This number has just recently matched the prescriptions for benzodiazepines before the
Miltown scandal in 1973.
The effects of Benzodiazepines on the body and mind, aside from its intended
purposes as an anti-anxiety agent, are numerous.
The drugs show clear efficacy for the first week, and then
their advantage over a placebo abates. But, as British
investigators noted in 1991, this brief period of efficacy
comes at high cost. ‘Both psychomotor and cognitive
!

SW!

functioning may be impaired, and amnesia is a common
effect of all benzodiazepines,’ they said. In 2007,
researchers in Spain looked at whether these adverse events
negated the small ‘efficacy benefit’ provided by the drugs,
and found that the drop-out rates in clinical trails, a
measure often used to assess the overall ‘effectiveness’ of a
drug, were the same for benzodiazepines and placebos
patients (Whitaker 133).
The study showed that benzodiazepines, although they provided short-term relief by
numbing our ability to emote, had no benefits that were worth the negative effects. In
spite of this their popularity soared. Perhaps the direst effect of benzodiazepines comes
during withdrawal from the drug, as expected from one of the most addicting substances
ever given to humans.
Physicians at Pennsylvania State University unannounced
that patients withdrawing from benzodiazepines often
experienced ‘an increase in anxiety above baseline levels
[…] a condition that we term ‘rebound anxiety’.’ In Britain,
Lader reported similar findings, ‘Anxiety rose sharply
during withdrawal, and to a point of panic in several
patients. Patients commonly experienced bodily symptoms
of anxiety, such as a choking feeling, dry mouth, hot and
cold, legs like jelly, etc. Patients withdrawing from
Benzodiazepines, it seemed, were becoming more anxious
than they had ever been […] In addition to rebound anxiety
patients could experience insomnia, seizures, tremors,
headaches, blurred vision, a ringing in the ears, extreme
sensitivity to noise, a feeling that insects were crawling on
them, nightmares, hallucinations, extreme depression,
depersonalization, and derealization (a sense that the
external world is unreal). Withdrawal, one patient told
Heather Ashton, was like living death… I thought I had
gone mad. (Whitaker 137)
The unwanted effect of Benzodiazepines goes on through the usual symptoms of
madness. Aside from the counterintuitive effect of Benzodiazepines to induce ‘rebound
anxiety’, they can also induce such symptoms of delusions, hallucinations, seizures, and
extreme depression; these are the leading symptoms of such mental disorders as
schizophrenia and bi-polar disease. One can now see how easily patients taking the

!

choice to come off benzodiazepines may find themselves in a mental hospital diagnosed
with a slew of mental disorders, while being forced to take a number of additional
medications. This occurs quite commonly in the field of psychiatry: “Most patients find
that anxiety symptoms gradually increase over the years despite continuous
benzodiazepine use, and panic attacks and agoraphobia may appear for the first time.
These studies and observations told of a very problematic long term course, and in 2007,
French researchers surveyed 4,425 long-term benzodiazepine users and found that 75
percent were ‘markedly ill to extremely ill” (Whitaker 137). These patients, who were
shown to be extremely ill, also exhibited extreme depressive episodes, severe anxiety
disorder as well as mental disability. This is shown in their inability to memorize facts,
do simple problem solving and learn new information. It can be said that these
individuals did not truly experience madness and insanity until after they were abandoned
and left with the control tactics of psychiatry, leaving them even more susceptible to the
madness they sought to escape.
Solutions
Perhaps what can be said after this grueling list of treatments for madness and
insanity created by the Psychiatric Institute is that they all have one common aim: to cure
madness through the mechanism of control. By capturing and chaining the insane, the
General Hospital and governmental establishments were able to rid the streets of social
deviancy and rebellion through punishment and control. To silence the mad from within
the asylum, they were ignored, humiliated and controlled through the constant presence
of guilt. The mad are controlled today through toxic chemicals that create a cycle of
addiction and dependence that permanently degrade and mutilate their brains, often to a
point of complete helplessness and deterioration. Additionally, the rate of mentally ill
individuals is rising due to the misappropriation of basic human emotions to symptoms of
greater disease, rather than symptoms of human nature and physiology.
Today, there are methods of treating mental illnesses with techniques that do not
involve these controlling factors that hinder the process of healing. These methods use
the process of communication and personalized care to deal with the Psychospiritual

!

crisis at hand, as opposed to covering up these emotions through tranquilizers that render
patients unable to change. “[At Keropudas Hospital in Torino, Finland] ‘The language we
use when the patient is sitting with us is so different from the language we use when we
[therapists] are by ourselves and discussing the patient” (Whitaker 339). The staff at
Keropudas Hospital makes a strong effort to familiarize themselves with their patients.
This allows them to develop a relationship with each therapist that destroys the patientdoctor relationship that is based on professionalism and inane décor.
Western Lapland had discovered a successful formula for
helping psychotic patients recover, with its policy of no
immediate use of neuroleptics in first episode patients
critical to that success, as it provided an ‘escape valve’ for
those who could recover naturally. ‘I am confident of this
idea,’ Seikkula said. ‘There are patients who may be living
in a quite peculiar way, and they may have psychotic ideas,
but they still can hang on to an active life. But if they are
medicated, because of the sedative action of the drugs, they
lose this ‘grip on life,’ and that is so important. They
become passive, and they no longer take care of
themselves. (Whitaker 341)
The therapists at Keropudas Hospital keep psychiatric medication use to a minimum and
focus instead on treating patients naturally. They do this by personally attending to the
ideas and problems of each patient. The therapists are greeted with calm and openminded patients who find they have complete freedom in their choices and actions to a
sizable extent in comparison to ‘professional’ treatment.
Instead of alienating the patients from their natural emotions, they are encouraged
to express themselves honestly and comfortably in a non-professional setting. It is this
factor that truly separates Freudian psychoanalysis and the treatment in use by the staff at
Keropudas. The doctor-patient relationship, which Freud thought was essential to proper
psychoanalytic technique, is ignored in favor of building proper relationships.
The therapists consider themselves guests in the patient’s
home, and if an agitated patient runs off into his or her
room, they simply ask the patient to leave the door open, so
that he or she can listen to the conversation. ‘They hear
voices, we meet them, and we try to reassure them,’ Salo
said. ‘They are psychotic, but they are not violent at all,’
Indeed most patients want to tell their story, and when they
speak of hallucinations and paranoid thoughts, the
therapists simply listen and reflect upon what they have
!

SY!

heard. ‘I think [psychotic symptoms] are very interesting,’
Kurtti said. ‘What’s the difference between voices and
thoughts? We are having a conversation. (Whitaker 342)
Instead of the usual psychoanalytic method of “talking cure”, the therapists engage the
patients in casual conversation, whereas in psychoanalysis the psychoanalyst encourages
the patient to speak and for the most part listens. By distancing themselves from the
professionalism from both psychiatry and psychoanalysis, the therapists are able to reach
a mutual understanding with the patients. This allows them to encourage each other as
human beings, rather than a doctor to a patient. Results of the hospital prove to be
significantly more efficient than the American counterpart, “From 2002-2006, Torino
participated in a multi-international study by Nordic countries of first episode psychosis,
and at the end of two years, 84 percent of the patients had returned to work or school, and
only 20 percent were taking antipsychotics. Most remarkable of all, schizophrenia is now
disappearing from the region […] only two or three new cases of schizophrenia appear
each year in western Lapland, a 90 percent drop since the early 1980s” (Whitaker 343).
The results are cause for optimism, as they are proof that this epidemic can be turned
around, although the extent of the harm caused by this corruption will never be realized.
Madness is a naturally occurring form of passion and irrationality that must be
treated in some way, though it is clear that using control is simply exacerbating the
problems that they pose. Alternative forms of treating mental illness do exist and are
showing results that prove psychiatric medication and institutionalization are inefficient
and are only making the iatrogenic epidemic of mental illness a tragedy of human greed
and vice. Upon looking at these new forms of treatment it is clear that Kesey, as well as
Freud, had a proper idea of how the mentally ill should be treated; with the dignity and
respect that humans owe one another in understanding that, at times, life can make any
individual crazy. Perhaps, through the professionalized and strictly regimented façade,
psychiatrists forget that they are human as well as their patients and are too prone to
madness. It is possible that Freud said it best, a century before we realized it ourselves,
that “Neurotics fall ill of the same complexes with which we sound people struggle”
(Whitaker 128). We must accept madness and “mental illness” as an inseparable element
of life that should not be quieted through any means of control, but through empathy.
