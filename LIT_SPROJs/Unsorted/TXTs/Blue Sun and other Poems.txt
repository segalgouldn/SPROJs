Blue Sun

5

“Come shadow, come, and take this shadow up.”
–The Two Gentlemen of Verona
Dark Blue light of shadow
enwraps your candle
that is never christened
but of the blue, black sun.
Snuffs it and
you turn into
a Lion & a she-wolf
chasing your tail
at the very beginning
(that is what we return to)
that is what waits to begin, in the
eyes you see
reflect your solitary light.
But who are You
a man’s shadow in the woods?
No. You’re at a restaurant
where a snake
coiled around me
on Hermész Tér, and slid off into the dark, 1994.
Even the waiters scream,
the young sensitive ones
before they all came from Argentina
and I watch I a calm child on the cobbles
an exalted I behind my candle dark
hands on the tablecloth with no one across
from me facing the square a cool May evening.

6

I
This is where I really wield my snakes
in the basement of the steppes of the self
where I unthaw them, “Nothing but solid earth
beneath these planks.” And a ghost chardonnay,
the hairy women of my dreams drawn out of
the ashes of every moment. “And I had brought
a pack of cards!”
to combobulate everything
I cross the road and sacrifice my egg
an investigation carried out in the dark
wet from lemon dripping through the salt–slabs of our stellae
so much dark and citrus its hardly legible, there’s no waiting
for it to stop, no such thing as waiting– these trembling eggs renew
the lease: call the bluff of all prefixes
I really don’t know any better to let it alone so many broken eggs
to feed the offshore bank account of my stomach
for what else is lust but how long it takes the author
to reach Adam and Eve again again
find you beneath all my pretending
God and my daughters know I’m not asleep my ribs for a subtle music
a blue horse trots by my yurt there’s nothing between my heart and this
foggy Mongolian dawn, everything straight-forward
works vertically my basement rubs against the sky
it’s the horizon that has to do with numbers
nonsense weather and conditions
climb it like a ladder a cathedral without shadows
or the shadows of the devout
at the end of the day have to fill the demon-quota
what’s a particular besides priming the pump
feed it through the verb of our patronym
only later do we find out what this means
not by holding the source maybe a glance
when prudent when I say so my blue other
a blue world on the margins of my body
synecdoche that’s the sort of thought we’re great at

7

chop down a tree and you will not find its idea
you have to plant another one inside to understand
lift a cow every day to see how light it is
I plant my oar in the desert like a dead heart
pretend its worthless that’s what makes the gods happy
now only you and I to tally up our limbs in the dark basement
(pah!) the only debt we pay each other is listening
my drones go back to the center of the earth
now that you’ve found the real me shot out all
the mirrors their Americans in white suits in shards
now only Csongor amidst the rubble Tamas always escapes
without extracting the oar from the desert of Csongor’s eyes
laughter echoes from the secret library
O the pastimes of those rich in names!
I am Csongor
in Pest
I remember a friend of my mothers in the middle of winter
named Csongor when I didn’t let him in, then flailing
his red hands my hands are cold never what we mean
all the doors open in it’s a fire hazard
we haven’t learned anything for the future but you to ya’ll Atman
or Domus whatever comes to mind redounds
but the plural of I is not we
the function is the name of a line trace each back
this is Csongor’s poem you can’t have it
nothing is yours you’re the output of my prescience
a run pause closed high note
and low open dunked in a pool
water over your ears oxytocin something physical
makes music all those measurements breaths
everyone always counting my fussy stay-at-home body
music is our gossip how we say there’s room for you in me
you’ll know I love you when your ear starts to bleed.

8

Sing against the music
Vac like a panther among the notes
any moment a diapason her great jaw unhinged
that’s natura naturans;
the Pillars of Hercules make good honest sense.
dip the toes in a pool always the same but different
it’s our commonalities that nihil ulterius that prove
with the greatest strength inconsistency
sometimes Eve sometimes a Tree grows from the side of infinity
sometimes I wake up in Bottom’s Dream in
The Comedy of Errors talking in the dark
the shadow my look alike not knowing what I look like
cover the mirror and I’ll measure the room.
…
your inmost councils flood over the plain
red lightning in your acoustic shadow
the mouths of time mouth for you narrator
forgotten united in you come for
their debt O royal I touch us feed us
O great neurology of people I give him to you
High Priest of my house wooden god in the basement
his symbol be it integral or forte
find him under the rug because there’s no good way
to say look under the lawn there I’ve stowed
the metonymical stone reaching to infinity
eat it it engenders a care for the self a music a power over space and time
close the door to open it the raven steps in
thought gets stuck without a baptism now and then the blue sun sinks
back into everything else ‘tis the wind you say
tis a chair with a coat on it I’m irrational with logic

9

II.
The windows foggy this morning the Soon and the Moone
the green lion condenses into corporeal perfume
it’s time to harvest the details
a mantis crawls on my side outside
the library it isn’t merely an ungainliness I said
to the spectators I brought it from home
“Our Soule, our Stone, borne up with wynd
In the Erthe ingendered…”
I don’t have it in me to bag the green-beans today
to say the earth is dead and Hermes Trismegistus
ashes no one dies in my poems the earth is
amulet, stitch in time
simple breath that says there’s nothing
to prepare you for to undo
the unexpected meet it all here in me
I know all the first names forget the signs
we’re still in the cathedral
but this time columnar birdsong
and I’ve already kissed the lepers away
back into the fortissimo of the vaulting
why else these apsides– to carry
our note into the souls of the poor
poorer one communication I get my
voice into you you’re safe now
you understand.

10

The Couple, for Joel Oppenheimer
I read Oppenheimer and find he, too, had:
“jesus strung from a dogwood.”
Neither of us remember why, and I
mourn this fact in the man
I have never lived in
the same year as. That same
sort of humanism which says
“how else to be fecund if not
to put up with a man.” Who cannot share
in this religion, in the fruit
of our confederacy? We will put up
with no other sort of man.

KINDRED SPIRITS

An ark of driftwood, wood of what they held out on me
A
but could not extinguish the traces of, learned things
learned into habit although the Way forgotten
meta-genetic gleanings, I mean faces

in dance rehabilitation, which is to say the polarities
reverse –
You push me off and the rollers are a description you slip out of
B
my power now there is a great eye aloft now there isn’t
one is for you one is me you lend me your bitter ship
and I sail out of sight who knows what I think about that
the great eye stares at us both it will always be in your favor
when I sail around the island and scatter my boat along the beach
before the man who prowls the beach, who may or may not know.
– until the wind
A
from your watch flies out the hands compass
around your mark and the many blindings of directionment
flood, flood old world frame
as soon as I break my coke bottle on the boom! a sudden blow
the debts of this world fly back to their spark

On the Range
Rhetoric: The art of using language so as to persuade or influence others; the body of
rules to be observed by a speaker or writer in order that he may express
himself with eloquence.
O.E.D.
1553; T.Wilson: Rhetorique is an art to set

furthe by utteraunce of wordes
matter at large.
1561; Eden, Arte de Nauig: Such a mutuall

compassion of parte to parte….
by one common sence existent
in them all.
(Note the weight of these sentences: bound largely in the final, almost trochaic phrase,
turning the sense outward, or upon itself.)
Vac; goddess of speech for the
Rg Vega poets:

I move with the Rudras, with the Vasus, with the Adityas and all other
gods. I carry both Mitra and Varuna, both Indra and Agni, and… I am
the one who blows like the wind, embracing all creatures. Beyond the
sky, beyond this earth, so much have I become in my greatness.
Held within a function
are the imaginary numbers
any given now conjoins.
The Inuit Alignak: only (named)
god of eclipses, also of earthquake, (land–tide
tide, water and weather.
The black sun jumps out
from behind our regular
one.
(Note the Algonquin myth When Tcikabis Trapped the Sun. It is a testament to sun’s
liveliness that a “madman”– the constant threat of incursion by another understanding
(and there always is another)– lurks behind it.)

(Note Woody Guthrie’s I Just Wanna Sing Your Name)

The Histories
(Book I)

15

I.
I am not in a position to say
if their language held any certainties;
the places have all changed their names:
judging by this they were not us
although they learned our language
which has never changed.
They came in ox–carts
wounding themselves in exchange for the Acropolis
in the way of short–livedness, and we were content
to offer our prayer
to tall, pretty girls.
While on the plain of Tegea
buried at the head of two
contrary winds
lay the bone keys for dancing
without chains.
Where the intellect fell upon the anvil
beneath the bellows,
and the smith put aside his smoldering griefs
to tell you something amazing, about bottoming his well.
Croesus neared those who ate figs
and had nothing
in ambush in the framework.
Who held Croesus’ brother–in–law
brokered for peace during the eclipse
in the limits of that year
as each party
licked the others blood
and the river
was made to flow
on both sides of that summit. They
inundated Solon’s Croesus in half the time
it took to explain the snakes, the Lydians
having leapt off their horses and elbowed their way through
what had been set off in their coming
scaled the wall
no man had thought to pass a lion across,
which is to say: the dumb half–soul of Croesus had begun
to speak, through a peep–hole in the kingdom of his melancholy.

16

II.
The Solons never lie
but flee their own laws
prophets can’t have jobs
but keep themselves allowable
deaf and dumb
Solon who conceives a mill from Croesus;
the happiest man in the world:
his progenitor divided
to techne following his nameless, positive
half–soul through the underbrush, to meet with death
or dinner, or the apparition
of Croesus
cooking lamb in a tortoise–shell, by the fire
of a Gloucester–candlestick
100 days hence, made with the Iron
of this moment.
The business of Croesus’ eye
a spew of feathers across Persia.

17

III.
Croesus tossed his backgammon set into the sea
and walked away as Cyrus, for Cyrus had led him there
after two pages of ancestors
carrying this residue
of The City of the Sun.
Cyrus borne through still–births
dreams & elephants
his bodies displaced by hermaphrodites
& she–wolves.
Cyrus also of Solon
who slaughtered his father’s livestock
in exchange for the whole of Asia
(having wreathed
Croesus with his
Myrtle)
throws the backgammon set into the sea again
to have done it both drunk and sober.

18

IV.
Yet this
This strengthening will not change the terms
as long as you were dancing then
one armed, one legged
around the four dialects
like a mortar,
as long as neither Croesus
nor Cyrus
impedes the man from Halicarnassus
in nailing his tripod down
at home, and his home
out of the community– although the community remained
twelvefold–
and demanded of Cyrus
their cisgender
under the guise of losing
their own revolt,
and sailed their leader
past the harbor of Panoramus.
So Cyrus built mountains, to cover their
release
from the city, in whose harbor they sank
a lump of iron,
with their curse.
Cyrus, led the men
stabbing in the air to the border of Calynda
defending every isthmus, lashing every island
to the mainland
at the price of the Xanthians, every man jack of them.
Every god shut
inside their temple
that they be available
for intercourse
(if one were to pass Ardericca three times
on three separate days, as they sailed down
the Euphrates).
There the bridge was built
by which Cyrus measured
the year
and entered the city
of infinite expanse

19
whose administration
is irrigation
and carryable
in a skin boat
supposing your staff
is carved with a rose, or a lily, or something,
so you walk at the pace of that town.

20

BOOK II

21

I.
Solon works a hut in
himself,
having thrown out the ocean
in exchange for a river
without breezes.
Cyrus left for Cambyses,
Croesus sent back to Persia
drunk on the smell of wine
culled from a horse
in the sun.
Cambyses headed towards what I had heard in Memphis
de–named bone–lute
rivering the months
under the skin of the intercalary
nude in Egyptian silt
the measure of this new land
the distance between the names of the gods
silt of that vigorous river:
the here’s and there’s of Solon,
the flux of debts, that newness
Cambyses sings
his highest note
flat from the mountain shells
drawn through a cove
of red sand
sprinkling its salt
over the Pyramids.
An Egypt too wise for Zeus’ water
but powerless over those
who come to the land with tools
with borders obstinate against boundaries.
Here the sun is driven by storms
into the clear air
as a cool wind blows from somewhere cold.
As it’s always been,
just ask the scribe.

22

II.
Lassoed to your elephant
through the desert
of the Asmakh
where those un–jubilee’d
nomads transposed themselves
mano a mano
with Ethiopians. Anyway, a desert
the same distance as the river.
Source being
abduct– or inductors in wait
by the first tree
whose language no explorer can understand
taking you to the crocodiles in that
darkness.
And return walking backwards.
Priests who practice
thousands upon thousands of observances
till they cannot even stand the sight of
an impure legume
or a bull with a black hair.
(I recalled Cambyses as they removed the guts
& the legs
by the weeping cows of Isis
Dionysus having nothing to do with it
but Osiris
from here the names descend
into time
from this fluid, tied to the moon,
the men cowled like fish, perceptions
allegoric, and by the syllable;
browless foreheads
every man a Heracles
if they look kindly on words.

23

III.
The local inhabitants expose themselves
the women with clappers,
the men flutes, in honor of Isis.
And for Pan all the lights in Egypt left on,
the priests of Ares beat each other
with sticks on the stairs of the temple,
learning anything is out of the question
as a crowd presses around
a goat and a woman
the cats leap in the fire
and all the wood
removed from the set
(although it still weighs the same).
Amidst the lighting a tar–black
Ibis kills the winged snakes,
filling the isle with spines.
As for the actual people of Egypt…

24

IV.
But the caves of Memphis long inundated
the queen having thrown herself into a cheerless chamber
the old flame displaced
rises in a column
at the end of every main–street, by the gate.
But these too have been pissed out
or turned to obelisks
of ghostly hospitality.
In the center of town
around the sanctuary of Hermes, the trees
touch the sky– so long as you are a blind king
exiled on an island of ash,
having thrown your eyes
at the Pyramids
so the island in lake Buto
becomes a floating island
and a canal is drawn through the red sea;
as the Eleans are banned
from the Eleans
and Amasis
farts in the direction of Amasis
having learned no trade but warfare.
Amasis, in whose city flits
the shadow of the man from Halicarnassus
under the spectral law of Solon, whose Canopic Mouth
mutters its oaths
as The Flame passes
through the blue obelisks of Memphis
–glint of Cambyses’ eye
as he stalks along some nameless quay.

25

BOOK III.

26

I.
Cambyses demanded of Amasis
a wife, or a mother
from Indo–European roots
joined briefly by the man from Halicarnassus
as they regained Memphis
Croesus seen to flit through Amasis’ dying eyes
and into Cambyses,
or perhaps was just a vision…
a lightness
as it sinks
in the oily pond,
as light jets in its otter form
Croesus painted
chalk white in a
Crystal Coffin
set upright
on the Table of the Sun
stares at the town, gathering dusk. Reciprocal Cambyses:
his men on a mud-march, eating grass;
his sailors buried in sand
for the mismanaged defense
of his purest fear, the bodies of his house
in ruination, as the cow of symbols
dissolves in the sanctuary, the sanctuaries all
placed before his blind will, to the final destruction
of his immortal tendernesses.
His miscreant sons carried off one–by–one
until finally, irretrievably, he is alone before his Magus.

27

II.
The house of Cambyses come to rule no one,
or just one,
whoever, his name is Darius, condemned to silence
along with his horse
his children
the black milk of the dissolution of Cambyses
variables halted
on a singular variability
and the rock–rose
culled from the beards of he–goats
will have nothing to do with him
in perfuming Arabia;
nor may he rest in the river
made up by some poet
or know if the end of the world
is attractive or not.
He will have nothing, which is his power
culled from his losses; he rages in loneliness
across the plateau
facing obstinately the cliff–face
and in the exponent of all suffering a new sound
rays forth from his inner ear.

28

THE STORY

29

PRAELUDIUM

A horse telling the story of a tree
forget the relatum
but feats of love at my desk like a shaman
I drink tea with my mind
I make satisfaction, working alone at my task
I ruin the garden and in the kitchen commit faults
I am always leaping.

30

I’ve come in this way because there are no windows
or doors, and I knew you were in here, with everybody else.
I will take nothing, if I can get something.
Here the mother is not too old, the daughter not too young.
I avail my self not of the spectacle but the sensation.
I devour the egg and leave its unbroken shell empty.

31

after Head 1, 1953 by FRANCIS BACON
What were the epiphanies, which calmed into the body?
Colors threatening home upon the world at large.
And the story? Somehow things were fine, equitable,
the story digested digests now it is
planted in the pineal gland and metabolizes
the narrative into hot or cold
forgotten into the story the narrative is forgotten
into sensation. The story: against all
pre-prepositional probability wipes anything typical
or what happened last time from the narrative
and as the story sits like a cat on the table
the only thing to do is keep track of how large or small it is.

32

“I pick up my club.” Who are we talking to
is who is this talking
I pick up my club and smash the nearest thing
it does not wait like gold birds to give answers.
An instant of hunting and being hunted:
leave the club alone and it will beat itself
to nothingness. Pick it up too often
there will be no one left to talk to.
And if I pick up my flower? If I have a flower
like the first man ever to have one
I will look out across the flowers of this
world and give this particular
to the first woman my nefesh goes for.

33

He made his way
in the epoch of a decomposed ray of light,
or what pretended to be so; casting its
phony lineaments around his club
and his flower. He had already
forgotten what had befallen the narrative.
He imagined a garment of hide to wrap
tightly around her thighs. He would
tailor her clothes when she bathed.
He would become the first tailor.

34

The spectator can convince himself of what has been
so far described; the appearance of a square
near the round disk – a large water prism
placed in the sun – edges appear, the center
deeper red, redder and deeper the angles decline
in their proof. The spectator can stretch himself
against the disc’s lineaments, be it a cup or a shoe: he is as a round of bows.
A span. You can convince him of anything.
He is attentive. Give him something
and he’ll go away. Like a mollusk.
He has already selected his shell from your pocket.
He has come for his shell and you must give it to him
like the table gives to the cat. Perceive
the blue, green shadows of Mont Blanc in
his heap of small luminous points. He is The Madonna of Birds,
the repeated images of the sun.

35

Yet he came across a saboteur,
the pickling jar opened prematurely.
Someone who hid within himself
and the preparations were made angry, and on an
empty stomach. His stone was defiled. The work hastily done.
So he chewed plantain leaves, because some things you eat alone.
He sat in the dark for a long time. He grew a beard
and then he shaved it.

36

He wandered without even a story.
With adjectives
he named the birds of prey of his
desert. It was already the
point of starting over. A golden sphere
flung up, the birds
swirled around him. As if in a
bodice of adjectives, the old dolce stil nuovo in his eye.

AT THE TOP OF THE POINT OF BEGINNING
1.
By the secret lantern I write
so that one still murmurs in the shed
behind the Lodge, and I turn the pen
in the wrong direction, you say
from what?
Mercury in its greatest elongation
West of the sun, its metaphysical
point of terror: I do not need to put my body
between the lantern and the stone-shaman’s
wall spread feel, a wall dark on the stone–
shaman’s wall he sits feelingly behind

we only tolerate dichotomy insofar as “analogy is understanding”
you know I’m really talking to the back of your head

(c. stein)

my lantern lit behind the wall like an eye
in the possession of all light, dormant
ecstasies we need only to touch things come alive
I schlep the sun over the back of the world
am the sun and the lion who devours it
and the king who drinks the lion’s blood
the stone-shaman dances in the color
and heat of the wall’s proto-human flicker
only in company does he think who he is
may we see him only when he thinks is there
company and his thought is dawn
every day he builds Utopia
the open and close of his intraocular eye
in the rock, maybe this is “The great White Dog
not Interdicted by opinion” who has hid
in the rock since the Egyptians “took from the Dogs
Their access to Heaven,” whose shout is every direction
and it means come here.

This is the anvil

The blacksmith begins his work

laughter slips out the back like a broken cup.

Everyone’s here, who knows why
here’s the dance and in the dance-hall a party lecture

It is necessary for a certain space to exist, because a sensible object,
when placed directly over any sense, is not noticed.
–Giordano Bruno, On the Composition of Images, Signs & Ideas

“A whole world of pain is contained in these words.” How can it be
contained in them? – it is bound up with them.
–Wittgenstein, Culture and Value

46

Written from Dec./2013–Feb./11/2014, most of the poems in this book reckon a
structure capable of truthing the real and the dreamt, the false and factual: not
dissolving these designations but bringing them into play. Raising the voice of their
synthesis. The Dark Webs are the commonality our disparate parts portend, where
“Washington, Franklin, Paine & Warren, Gates, Hancock & Green;/ Meet on the
coast glowing with blood from Albions Fiery Prince.” As for the other poems, I
found them on the shore.

Intermezzo
1.
Won’t the raspberry juice
run everywhere! with a child
alone in the house, in this tedious
peasant town. And the peasants–
they still think its an intermezzo
despite
the blood–rites
so they will be disappointed:
not know about the calendrical patching up
of things– the way Strauss was in
the stork, or how the waitress blushed
when she saw how much lamb was on my plate
obstruse dirty thoughts’ brief
enlightenment, the object only matters insofar as it does
so long as the story gets to telling
everything’s the same that way
its all so dear to syntax
he has all 20 day signs on his body and costume
the way real fat men are always falling in love
taste everything, that’s how we see, by tongue
you’re all the exercise I could ask for
licking things I mean
that’s the sport you let me continue:
Mr. Windchimes,
I name you a double-name
you say things so I can hear in them
hear my own name traced back to the wind
there’s nothing to be scholarly about
ad pondus omnium being directional
we level with each other’s/ the instances
of you make sudden me and senses
between us the faint glow of rotting wood
shape of the animal you carry faint ness of you
come water your sheep in me
in my perfect parts

48

…
the parts you didn’t read
thought thought not to be thought
what’s buried alive
what wasn’t there to be read
what doubtful in hopes secreted away
made the rot in us
sheep shaped shadow on the field we where
like some crevasse where the eyes
don’t go, still and weightless in the field
I quiver under the morning, that broken
latch of your thighs, act out the shadows
of my back in that place– and through
body giving way to the blood
Intermezzo to intermezzo
a play like light runs down yon hill.

49

2.
It was the telling from our
body the indefinite yet zoned
whence, that occasional origination
(puff on the horizon) we couldn’t flarf
no taste can change tasting
if we’re careful not to knock dream
out of the tree, the hanged man’s threat
that dream will cease to support us
But what great man was ever scattered in his boots
right at the All, without getting in that
he was the busy of something, Shakespeare’s
Joan of Arc, “Peter is the strings of the orchestra,”
rabbit living in the vertebral harp
you’re a real zoo lets not go into it
definition offends the nature of your animal
and I never contradict myself
among the monsters the unguess’d offices of pre-dawn
still with a knife in his teeth in the drizzle
in lightening blue time of re–marriage
dawn’s leg–work disappears shadows
tacked onto their objects again– and our dashing young
pirate peeks almost totally hidden out therefrom.
a sturdy showre of rayne/Tooke wise Apollo from himselfe againe.
the way, Agamemnon, foredoomed!
everything is a proof for Troy
and anything needed can be seen again, summoned
from its spirit world to recount even for the first time
its story– the waitress with the Greek legs brings me
exactly what I wanted and returns to the wall-eyed fog.

POST ELEGIAM LAUDES
“–ideally, any line could stand alone, be my Last Words, my epitaph.”
R.K., Uncertainties
After writing your death poem
you did not die
which was a great relief. I of course
banked on nothing: The Clavis Magna,
that opens no door, is not a key
but a problem you will never solve
problematizing all the problems
you can keep not solving. I banked
on The Great Key that opens nothing.
That’s problematic, which means what,
but to bring to life
havocs on the infrastructure of dailyness
that merciful constancy of inconsistency
without which the structure
our inquisition would plug along
empily filling its condominiums like some sun
no one bothers to magic
an unproblematical sun
never scorching the earth never even
writing here on a tree
never making trouble with
too many lovers, living a life
that is not life, not problematic, like the most precious things
like The Great Key that opens nothing
especially not Nothing.

51

The Message, for Sylvia
There are certain inalienable distances,
durations without space
signed things: Akkadian cuneiform
constructed from golden rectangles
things I can’t prove in the earliest Mesopotamian
language: fragments of their religion
what the genital god f.w.i.b.’d today, 4,000 B.C.
his conjunction is the same now
same architectural form of the Devachan: that house of us
from which feelingly and in different keys spinning
in our own directions we recall our memories, the images we’ve placed there:
adjects, what lives in the house we share against time.
We call those to mind, and in the difference of each room
where your lamp is my crotch: from qualis to qualitas
in the misdemeanors of friendship
we find the signal fires are lit.
Intelligible in the pidgin of our feeling
we do nothing but mean.

____________
f.w.i.b: for, with, in, by. Acronym for the Latin Ablative case. Bruno suggests using the
body to recall declensions.
Devachan: god-land. In Anthroposophy, the two realms of the astral body. The Lower
Devachan is that of feeling, the Higher, intellect.

In the House of the Plains
Here I am she said. Dust mites (here) are the tell all. On a plain. In such a fog. None but
the sun would have it. I am in a room, on the plain. I know, she said, for the bits that hang
in the air of a clean room, small hooks for time, the pots and pans of the plain, they say it
all. I am of that age, a day of mists and mites. The room smells of. Not mine, said she.
Not now at least. Or an old cloth, what weighs in the thick. Not my cloth. I touch my face
and feel my hand’s age here I am. I see on the desk by the view a sole white sheet with
two signs inked on the bas-de-page. That is my age. I will be done here when I am done.
When the signs cease to hold me and give way. And I am solely heft. In the thick of
them. Here in it all. You’ll know where to find me.
*
I am close in it. Or not. She is a church of. Bring yours to see. When in one like a thief in
town she breaks in them all. Thief of you. Break into me, she said. I am a child in the
well of wells. I have burnt this place and am brought back in the cloak of the wind. I
cease to lift the signs but they do not cease to lift me. They tell me your name and I come
a hand that won’t close. I bring all to be made of. A croak in the wind.
*
The plains are still here. They don’t care what town you’re from. Where two towns meet,
that is the plains. Where next to the trash heap, sat on the fence by a few small shrubs and
trees. She says hey pal like the sound of wizz she is muse- I call and you see her in an old
black hat and she looks good she does not need her front tooth for her legs she looks like
most mid-west girls would sans one tooth which I like all the more hey pal she says you
think the plains are just some thrift store for your mind to list through you think plains are
just for your mind, where all the way in New York you don’t think. My lad– I mean gal I
can’t stop think– to have you in my mind. I want but to prof– doff my love to you is all.

53

The Hub, for Lucas
You are the middle place
of the four cardinal directions
which ever way they supposedly point
one of them is you
you are the back
to make sense of the three
you could not cast a shadow
nor could your shadow cast one
were it otherwise
were you anywhere but the back
which is the middle
between two ups
where you face the back of things
where one weighs the front (where
what it takes courage to face
lives. It is important to face that,
Zeno did and we still think it
a paradox. Zeno put
the back in front. Turn your
back to face the music
he said, to go up, as in
I’m going up from Assur to Marduk
and then up from Marduk to Assur
you must believe in your back
because there is no way but up, every place
is its own god
every place is comprised of three images
and man
is the fourth, completes
the seal and the seal
floats belly up
the three images in the swash
made sense of by the back
and this seal is every place
and the god of that place
calls its back the ground
where man lives, the ground
is so much ecstasy under which
the gods cast the shadows of their
backs

54
and man realizes
the ground in him where he is like I said
between the three images of which he is fourth
and the up of them, and the god of his place
just as soon as he gets up.

The Drifter
I have an old friend
whose icy sidewalks
morning better watch out for
who talks about today
late at night, in a bold words, perhaps
in front of the Laundromat.
Ground through the mill
and through the grindstones
he smokes Carlton Lights
“tasting all its old
associative power” like bland
gum of prophecies.
His is the promise of a matinée
at any theatre where
no movie is showing.
He is shaped like an old friend
and you can’t quite see him
because far away, and his back to the light.

59

The Ball
I sought the ball in America
back to the driveway of an old house
rebuilt, mini–golf up the street
permanent “Now Open” sign
in America
I sought my first word, ball
first for everything, Unity externalized
the world made of this.
Return address. Like a lover flanked by silence
she demands new platitudes
self evident in countenance.
I steer my desk over the horizon, over its own
simple horizon, America opened, simple
as a fathoming, a shared word
for all beyond retention. Sun bowls us over
we can only insist, say our prayer
for the obtainable, and unobtainable same,
say our one word
braid of epistemes that is all deserving
mention, where all lives yet
and pick up the ball where we left it.

Tinjis, for Alana (somehow)
Brutish and crooked, it stoops down to dig
entrenches itself, back to the light,
face to darkness, to hear the center of the earth.
What shadow is this, common estimation,
familiar of opposites– where there is no light
no dark. Not a shadow, but one and the same
shadow to two bodies
the hidden of a thousand bestial forms.
She is not Truth, not built like presence.
Not so originatory, to be with or without. Older than name,
Tangier of Mauritania as much a viper
as Fortune she listens dug in her own
that is moon-rise sunset simultaneous
ends: equilibrium that is
“Tempo! Tempo! In all things!”
bestia trionfante dug in earth
hears the root, outward grasp of
the center she hears
banished from the heavens
the stars in earth blind sees in the way we
look up marries the children of earth
to this moment does not
dare dig further, hearing the root
the heaven from here.

62

The Scene
High Priest
an open vein, blood flows in
from open night:
vestment of semaphore
flies like to like
and moon closer
her inward watching
dissolves into the silver child.
Images each in their own way
nested with attendant shadows: those causes
come to a head, here
*
regularity, order,
a spirit common to every question
no. Forget what I said: all the High Priest wants
is for you to forget he’s there
out-of-order, the images
work but not for you,
false tautologies
is recreate
garb: adjectives. How will I
read this out loud
is inflection
the priest is not a priest
but from his horned cap
like frozen wind
leaves a wrinkle, in the air, signs his name
and is gone. It’s the body that goes home.
At night is nothing but question. Unvessel’d.
No answers. Brushes word matter from its teeth.

63

The Haruspex
letting in an ancient set of eyes
used to wizzing through gody night
stars that have read all that ink
let me in, let me see what’s hidden in you
unhidden from itself, let that think
we come from the far side of the dromenon: earth a lie, is variable–
start over, frequently
as possible, get off and stay here ever stable contrariety,
swimming against it the stream varies you
a matter of image
dizzy with restarting, tumbled claws, heads & tails of you
lifetime is how long it takes
to make your sort of net, year’s name for the
animals you’ve been, you’re the math
until they tie you to the core,
center their earth in your eye– start over
the point is the whole, must never be whole
because theirs is the definite, like eternal suffering
the conglomeration tumbles forward, seeking
its missing pieces, they are all mine
categorical as gift, La Llorona free from heaven
these are my children, the seen meant for stealing
I’ve sought you from the first, there’s nothing else
in my head, all the doors lead home: continuous repair of the non-existent loss
just lost, picking up things, here I am
here’s my address, employment deployment, dressed in the same
guts, the in and out of a moment, forgetting now and
stealing into the new, deeply convinced
thought over-thought loses value, break the glass
and drink, disregard your training
music thoughtfast takes quick hands and bumbling
scored gedankenstrich, missing the string
and striking the air

64

undercutting the rug to impenetrable nothing,
no reasons, no passport but what the flesh says: starting over, redoubled,
taking you with it and arriving you hither.

The animals you dreamt of, she said
had bi–valve hearts. And the worm I asked
since it is infinitely divisible? One

and I was cold– I had to kiss her to get back in.

Preparation for a Self Portrait
Blown over the rocks, faint sea–mist, the grassy parts, and thinned out, the canvas for a
good portrait.
Lyrical as the bones. To equalize from under,
set taxonomies, until you arrive, arise, index. All the wind could carry. Smelling of
source.
Made-up in it. Color–flash body encodes
trees, shutters, leaves, flags,
you semaphore.
Mirror and behind the moon back to the cause.
What reflection knows.
Smelling of Chlorophyll, a concentration.
All that you’ve questioned till the reflection gave way, to
reassemble. Resemble, again. Reassess. Inscribed sediment
self-consciousness whipped
into spontaneous heraldries,
caves of the now waiting for you a thousand years.
All that was built up in your coming. Arrivals reminders.
Remember when we both started out
walking in opposite directions.
Meet back here.

Incense Games

68

1.
The seraglio in distress native tongue “I hear my father curse”
textiles led back to the loom, bodiless, no such thing as empty
moves through the bodiless our conversational Ottoman forgotten
in Hebrew one of the souls speaking from Yankee Stadium
saying the first thing you knew before putting clothes on it
that is verse, cutting back
to the buried cries where it lives yet
chasing the words into their sillage following the smell
back to memories so old they
never started or existed the incense burning high
Babylon invaded through the foggy fields
walls green from return smoke curled up to the ceiling
the air still for description.

69

2.
I wag the flabellum draw forth the rhyme cimbalom quick flitter
to rarified far roofs crowded together municipal buildings their slow
goings on along the Duna city and river in sweet mists steep wet roofs
there’s no climbing but life in the thick street no knowing how
this is not where no precipice but a margin subtle as lost
train stations for directions this place is in the middle
no origin, built around the zoo
what is there to photograph cities within cities I see a rug store
in the back a courtyard of apartment fronts rugs and planters hanging
from banisters secret Babylon cobbled centuries
bloom invisible to the unwilling, people busy here
through walls, or on unseen stairs walking.

70

3.
They won’t let me in this is a painting
I can’t return to, lines I once understood
those other paintings like houses in Brooklyn
as it starts to drizzle
you suspect you’ve been locked in
since before you were you and see the thin light
of that hour coming in slants from the other
side of the planter
Pathetique you waltz your two left feet
from there, the paintings mean you can’t
see it, you can’t see a painting
because it’s covered in paint, all that’s left
is a rug getting wet on the banister, the smell of cooking
to tell you someone is calling your name
only they don’t know what it is.

71

4.
Salt–cod barreled on the wharf
stones or children sit atop juice soaking
up their coat backs, soaking into stone
land becomes an extension of sea
you bring it home with a handful of anchovies
whatever you fished out of the sleeping morning
like a woman’s shoe you wake up with it in your hand
wake that much less, until there is no dream
no wake no catch just the sea snoring
where its always been
gently next to you.

72

5.
An ancient text, yellowed sandalwood, I see the old Assyrian
accounts, the footstalks, tally-sticks rooted in a smoky
hand, debts carved in stone with cruel cunei, hungers of the
Goddess, I see Lapis Lazuli under Miscellaneous Expenses
and the desert opening wide on the red tents
I see men whipped with invisible switches traveling in
desolate ontologies of power, a mysterious woman feigning
to be Miscellaneous Expenses, red haired belly–dancer
glistening with oil in the dingy-lantern’d back-place
seeds under her tongue, her tongue pressed down on her hips
feet reversing the head, smoke tracks me away.

73

6.
I seek the bread, smoke before us, smoke seeking
bread and bread smoke and the bread fresh from the sea
aloeswood the smoke turned to bread and the bread
turned to wood and the wood fresh from the sea the bread
with the smoke in it seeking to be both I seek no bread
but the smoking wood and the fresh sea turning into the
sought the bread of the smoke in the fresh aloeswood
and in the sea of the sought you can smell the fresh
aloeswood and not confuse it for bread or something else
whose smoke travels to the wrong regions whose bread
allows no smoke and whose smoke seeks no bread and nothing
turns to aloeswood.

74

7.
I see the open field, meadows of Babylon
opened onto the vasty I am
always seeing
always open here the accompaniments
that is pasture, grass blowing
betray their smell
outside the gates the city reaches
arms farthought
the movement of Time, the field
is open in the smell of
bonded things
I’d rather be locked in than locked out
when it is open the smoke pours
forth, and it is open to me
propped open with my shoe
the shoe dream handed me
to come and go as I please
but I stay in the sometimes open field
because who knows dream could take the shoe away.

75

8.
In stillness no sight only the blind quiet sucking
air unseeing of the artful flame that takes
in is hidden in the wood illuminans obscurari
winter still outside the window silent construction
blocking the street, making nothing, stillness
this be the altar’s sacrify, the act and the consecration
I see a cardinal beating thrushes from his arbor
templum stillness limns, altered in its sacrifice
I see a red barn of the midnight railroad
the hour when we are all black lit by night
lit by silence the artful flame stillness
sucked in, billowing out, thrushes beaten from the spontaneous templum
smoke clears a world within itself
the gods are what flutters
at the borders, waiting to get back in.

76

The Dark Webs
relegating all conjunction
there is a hand
beneath the hand
that does all hands do (think Rodin) all they can do
the hanged man’s pickled
hand. This is the posture
of a perfect body
the Hand of Glory, that is not a hand
is not empowered by adjectives
but a dark web
granting the nexal real.
We call it a hand, the ‘Havatvernoni’
common-cosmic
strivings in toto (sd. Gurdjieff).
The web is an open hand
where the sun don’t–
where the sun is still intention
just below the surface.
This is what you know
substantify, think it knows
the way & why of you:
but the web knows nothing, only what it touches
the web is dark
Send a strong enough current
and I will feel it.
All possibility
does not know you
personally, but you know the web, the Hand
of Glory, that touches everything.

Exodus of The Pharaoh

78

1.

for Ann

To see what I was doing– hidden from the present’s
biographers, that was the question.
The solo violin, the voice of the story teller
rose from the clay as if there’s a third
person who’s not me– a red herring, Prokofiev’s
First Symph. the biographers bluffed by an empty
what was I doing unopened and dark in the basement
what were my realities as I compressed into
diamonds? Prokofiev kicking his samovar and yelling something
famous with his cat and writing this
this “beginning without end”
the before masquerades in, like looming Romeos present
behind every mask
chained in the basement of his symphony.

79

2.
So much for the hidden I’m always saying yes
holding the thought of the unknown in the mind
so much for an other it’s under this aegis
the coal press lit like a blue flower
pulled from the hip pocket light
as a feather I fan the trump
stormed by yes this beach
I pull the blue flower from the ten-thousandth
the doors are all unlocked from inside out
what will come is in wait start singing
and the song will find you crouched there
wearing it like a mask.

80

3.
The occupations are less
fearsome where they met their allegory
and now, breath rushing through Orpheo by the third act
nearly sung in he trembles delicate at the precipice
of the absolute, hanging by a thread at the point
of starting over, his bloody apron no more than happenstance today
the butcher hands my father a bag of meat
this is my bat mitzvah, I am old enough not
for anything, but to see the old
chair hoisted by Pharaoh’s slaves
dressed as relatives, that is in the old sense
Pharaoh’s slaves, relative to you.

81

4.
I lose my virginity under the pylons of Isis’
temple, in the postcard, still beating the slow
precision chisels the smooth towers overwhelm
that processual orgy– I had no choice, not even
to be myself, with my long back smeared in Sycamore oil
shoulders wedged against the porous stone
someone smelling of the river, like a wet dog
I can’t I thought, can hardly but the story starts
I put back the postcard this is my bat mitzvah
thumped by this omnipotence
reminding my body in the hallmark isle
I had been there, I slept with Anubis, and no one knows it but me.

82

5.
All poems start in Egypt, it’s your ship
moored in the distance that gives
way to you, the suggestion of a hip, far promontory
into the skin of the here, you live from suggestion to suggestion
stumble forward into the maybe of fact into another Egypt
the lesson rising ahead, seek it the sign of a hill, a
palm tree means ‘go this way’ you can’t get lost
the ley-line is talking everything you notice is
express to Egypt a divining rod
every palm tree is a bat mitzvah
the exodus has followed us
lodged in these flimming particulars.

83

6.
Integrating escape what supply city can be built
but the dodecapolis, the city we collect
and God dealt with the midwives, omitting what of
the story was a given leaving only events, only the tower
ahead this cupola staircase alley these belong to you
the rest you dress up that unknown the emptiness of everything
across the river, only here, where you make your city does
the ark of bulrushes trip you in the reeds
Prokofiev evening on The Pharoah, pulled out through the sycamores
through the sieve of the seen we end up here
no longer in mortar, in brick service but like the Gideons
break into every room, heap our house up around us.

84

7.
Egypt is never a destination once the world has a place to go
it doesn’t– Egypt steps out of the bulrushes and follows you home
goes where it needs to go, a hole in your pocket
that carries everything it has lost, the lost part of anything
you have, Egypt is where the bibles are kept, monologues
in the Pylons you have to listen carefully to hear
Egypt is your linguistic precedent, all the words we’d have
if we stopped calling it language, the hips we’d be
edged with trendy wisdoms to name the proclivities
prow Egypt follows you home you have only to
jump on its back under a full moon
it will take you somewhere.

85

8.

for C.S.

The Pharaoh waits for us earthly branches
heavenly stems, the twelve tribes find the 12 sons, more or less
no one is the output of form, we do not recall the physical lineage, but
call Jacob, and he calls back, tie the earth to heaven, names are our knots
Jack, Boca, you have to say what you don’t know, they hand you a cob
and push you into the Coliseum its your job
to figure out what this means, ward off the statements
the invariably wrong semantics we gladii are elided into name’s assemblage
you have your nearly whole cob, or candle,
almost full the light only you can see
there is only one piece missing, the 27th letter
without which you couldn’t see anything, you wouldn’t be.

86

9.
The Pharaoh glides uninhibited hyparxis forward
he has no eigenvalues but the Sphynx (that is, Pnyx)
animal below deck, thing that moves the sea
loadstone of those necessary democracies, the obvious ones
that never stop working, The Pharaoh smells like that,
like a Pnyx crouched beneath its suitors, Pylons that don’t
care which way you’re going situated at the antipodes
The Pharaoh glides through the city night asking everyone
where The Pharaoh is, this is the new on its own tail
the Pylons’ delicate happenstance preparing
the world’s bat mitzvahs making sure the poems
don’t keep all their promises.

87

10.

for M.I.

And The Pharaoh, nearing the Pnyx, having limned the wind
flawlessly replicating his own self–
creation, the moon full of him, wondered if it was
winter in that book, which continued its golden half–turns
from him dropping bits of amethyst at his feet
that (despite himself) was advance payment for the more
he was preparing (the processual esthetics)
morse goads subtly climbed him beyond comfort’s reckoning
the sheer volume of bat mitzvah was a paralysis and
I’ve never known how to talk about it
or any single way a one time fix nothing here but dream things
the sunken pylons on the wide desert and I was held like an unknown
<<in the mind until the blessing snake moved in the sand.

The Pharaoh can only tell one story, this is the last ship out
of Phoenicia, the same story because the only
even his friend Jatszik (to play) is real, and something new
happens every day, constant variation, newold myths
like phony First Symph.s images joined
to the stream of images, in salty syntax
of ear, eye, flesh The Pharaoh’s cruise
shored up wherever day does, at things bottom
from one to the next, unscrupulous drifter
through where meanings’ wires hang
The Pharaoh tells his salty tale
only he doesn’t know what it is.

Poem by Csongor
In the middle distance
“we couldn’t see the pictures”
between Vísegrádi Útca
& Kalvin Tér
between where I live
& was born
didn’t even think
Calvin, looking
right at him till
someone told me
and on Vísegrádi
finding Faludy’s house
next door after translating him
all month
catching the sleeves of things
in the lost woods
those knives
sail through
the known
into
(the unknown knives portend)
pictures of only
silver streaks
foggy disclosure
threatening involution
into smell
the spicy parliament
can barely keep hidden
behind my meat and potatoes.

Caryatid

You spin and unspin
unaware of where
loom lies
exercising your
dominion over
Time innate
gift everyone
has this movement
is the cloth of
what there is
isn’t, this way
you stay young
the finished
cloth is death
you are waiting
for someone spin
and unspin for
them to show
up and in
what denudes
itself is center
movement rounds
there is a house–
beam, mast
dug out of
air and you hear
soft tapping her
little moan
let me out.

NAHUM
He is meek, only wind lifts
the crepuscular skirts of Lebanon’s flower
and empurpled by the spoil of that
center, hill
stirs from hill (he is not drunk)
the dwellings of the lions
overflow, self made many NAHUM HUMAN
the folded mirror that is fire
mountains and the morning Assyrians acclaim.
Brothel of all the answers,
once in this flower:
the factual
opening of day.
NAHUM
sweeps the center
clean
NAHUM’s meek day
dances, proliferating
in the folded mirrors
flame
the Assyrians greet, yes
that meek NAHUM
unfolding in all
strongholds
(he opens)
his voice (in the clear referent) : the messenger. And NAHUM
who is NAHUM?
NAHUM comes with
flaming torches into the starless night.
He is the janitor of Nineveh
Burns the wicked gates
which pass emptiness
through everything. Wash the house of this.

93

The White Spider
A white spider haunts
a stack of documents,
a lesson
hovering over the facts,
the proven days.
Spider is allegory
where you were The
John, whatever that means,
shoveling snow. And gave
her chocolates
we know what that means
though we get lost in the feathers;
can’t know what that means:
lost in the days, proofs
too busy shoveling
to preside beyond our
size. Not so
the spider, the white one
lives around paper
white that hovers
and like an old friend
crawls up your hand.
Up your hand but lives outside
the mind– beyond those bounds
even now, redefining John
the way some stones do
to hold her, the way I
gave you chocolates with
stones in them and you ate them
you ate them all

94

we know what that means:
if there is a logic
I’m just a bunch of facts
you know what I mean
I pick up the white spider and
oh my god but it doesn’t seem to notice.

since when has
reality been trustworthy
I remember Brancusi
said to me, ‘I don’t

The wood is not wood
nothing is
not even the antelope
buffalo:
image lists we painted
to remember what’s not
what it is,
to carve from them
not in the silly way
but carve
our tools
from them
mark the gterma, the precious
teacup in every buffalo
living its life along the plains.
Tools, what works for us
in things, suave, half–mad
never there
if you break the skin.
Yes, it was a hot summer in Budapest
Transylvania was still part of the country
people know about these things.

her, Pogany, pagan, what’s caught
in the face, the line, an old memory
older than you, covering one ear
with both hands, hearing
what? head’s tilt, what body
says, words perched on
implied kinesis: the Flight of the Present
unverified, unproven, not so
originatory as to be past, or constant
or other. To be anything else
but here, so…
no so, party to nothing
only the criminal who would
steal this unofferable part
the decadence of figuring her
where no one is.

III.
No longer a Maiastra, Firebird
the teapot raises its haughty head;
yellow bird, sublime
we make subliminal.
Teapot. The gold screams
let me out, the bird
in the appliance. And horned fire
the water boiling
the bird
a bronze bull
the water
held in flame
steams
the illimitable main
still preaching
from its confines
let me out
the bird means
I’ve seen the water
from the other side
outside the kitchen
on my way to Gaeta
Morocco
was born
begot
renewed in the tree
before I learned
of men’s voices
before I sang
the song of man, their water
in my belly
the bird we learn
abstracted measurements
still reeking of secrets
screeching in the heat.

The Real Shifts
We can see the
angle
which makes
sternum
the two arms
hold moonrise
sunset:
roof’s angle, the
arms
holding them
up turn
down
and the sternum
thrust
at apex,
the safe place of architecture
hoisting the beams the shingles
out of boxes
even if we forget
the form
what it means is
still there
the residue
does not care
if you’re illiterate
the residual meaning
meanings reside
the returning side
turning away
but always there
unsure about you
(so we think)
the real shifts
at an incredible rate
only the briefest
glimpse
of its turn can be
lived, like
a coil
rotates
slowly
in the breeze, and
levitation
an upward
movement

takes us
with it
dropping the old planets
and prow’d
in sternum, to somewhere
we go off.

CALIFORNIA JOURNALS

102

1.
a water pattern made by a breeze off the coast
as you cruise down the highway, and maybe
flicking your cigarette onto the shoulder
it would be no worse than reenacting the revolutionary war
burning this place
you know, were it spontaneous, something necessary
in the way we’re given to express–– that is
the world tells us what to say
is our script (on a good day)
demanding to be set on fire
to start over, as it does, but we––
we have to elope, any way we can–– or the restorials
are ignored, and we won’t start over,
wont slip ourselves in where the old
offers room––
as you near and say
something about the price of meat
not thinking of your body, its dirty ideas––
and I throw my
cigarette out the window
on a black horse
maiastra
coming to kiss you.

103

2.
Land shaped
clouds
you impress me
press into me.
I am a simple man,
Carl
Sandburg was right, The people know what the land knows.
Clouds know what land knows, ridged––
and water
what does water know?
What people want––
that people want.
I don’t know what
only that clouds lift
from sea and
form across land
the way an answer forms.

104

3.
By the palm trees, it wasn’t Florida you said
but the place you go after. Palm trees in the snow
deeper than thought. We were in ‘California,’
in June, mosquitos in the snow; this is someone’s
real memory you said––
turning the snow over in the air.
Mosquitos.
We’re always expecting
Jesus, that’s neither here nor there, but
the memory, the ‘present’
and he between them, just for the pleasure
of talking about him, like a peach in motion
he moves. Is the pleasure
talking itself is: pleasure itself,
sort of disgusting
to the instincts.
Coming down from the peaks
of California
to tell the people
there is a place
for what isn’t thought
from the introduction to Plotinus, something
about the highest point in the realm of intelligence.
They don’t understand.
And he comes before them
like a house
built from the roof down
come from the paradise
that is just beyond sight.
Still wearing those meanings
we don’t know how to read.

105

4.
Redwood, the gulls
the road sweeping low among
boulders: culch––
meticulous as his own mechanism
Beethoven on the tape–deck
the weather
we weather
a metaphor in which one
lives forever
her thousand pieces
in the setting sun
glint,
and cruising down the highway
like Dionysus, delicate in her,
red heifer of the valley
open the image
slaughter the bull(k).
Slaughter the bull (the gendered gateway)
the blades of the 5th violin sonata
that let us into her
the very image of
an image the bull
weeping
with wild hair
(we seek a referent
the bull
in the rock– but in California
there are no Zodiacs, only
Books from the sky. This.

106

5.
In the sun the conquistador on the hill
the city gleam; the sun in its armor.
And a bluebird. Poets have stolen everything,
bluebirds make points. The conquistador
Montezuma saw and thought God–– and
wishing bluebirds were free I think
with Ben over lunch he says well
why not say everything is Intelligent
if emergence (of Mind) is not provable
fuck it (he sweeps his arm).
There is always some unbiased reality
you haven’t thought of yet is why not
I say lash together a thousand bluebirds
you might learn something about California.

107

An Air of Spain
1.
An air of Spain.
Ravel in the breeze, try as we may
to keep him out. Water on my feet
crouched on an islet
in the cave. Between the in/out flow.
Biotherm in the cave froth. Breathing in
speaking the deep breath of the cave.
And high above me the Nightingale plays
a song is subversion, for all the king’s men
lifting the North star from a piece of
porcelain. We do not leave behind
what is important to us. We see something,
ride the song out, or in.
Breathe back the cave. The circle of the
earth through you. The day in a crepuscule–
everything else spinning second–wheel.
2.
Figured out in my dream how to continue
lifting out and up, over the cave, from
the cliff face over the water, and
seeing the land, from the On High of
the broken fourth wall, a house, typical
to theory, small farming, the old church
like a cross falling head first off the land.
And a dirt road leading into town is no black mystery
maybe this time we follow it.
Through the fog, the non-descript spring
thaws, back to the Hebrew of the lands:
we’ll take this up later. The insistence
of the weathervane, an eastward wind of sight,
a tin can tied to my tail, the sheep their attendants
bow before this process. The mind
emerging from itself, pushed off
the material of thought, swings free over
Hyperborea, the land on top of your head. Where
we don’t know a thing, the circumspection
of what will be said. A place farther. Very
very far, past origin and into the draw.

108

An Observance
it is hard
hard to read
from the
bottom up
verse is
written
backwards
starting from the
sky poems are made
to dig, a prayer
rushes into
your mouth
nails you
to this moment
with your arms
crying out for it.

Birthday Poem for Emma and Marion
Through Neptune
we are born in Pisces
two
fish on a coffin lid
this is the oldest
sign, hatched from an egg
the two fish
Aphrodite & Eros.
Love, & Eros
the son.
The two fish
only women remember
(that is two
to make complicity)– the egg
and the simultaneous birth
of woman
and Eros, her son
reaching from her
tells us which way to go
directs us up stream, the son
directs us back
to the woman,
the Love that drags all
things in, the mouth &
hunger
a birthday party
no one leaves.

110

TWO POEMS
1.
What is there until
some discomfort.
What did
we know, we who knew
and yet asked.
Who can only say now, that it goes
if it goes, like the cognizance
of desire (how awful!) a train that never
fully arrives.
Sleeping with
the lights on– the profound is
discomfited from us
before we ask anything
there is a light, a stone
demanding an answer
wedged in your belly button, between us–
the poem goes on
if it goes on
and gets there
or near
to where it was
to what we knew.

111

2.
The goddess that
is mine, and the
woman I share––
cannot have
so completely, nor
should I want
to. The goddess
of the shared
a rock on the hill
we have worn smooth
the woman we have
worn smooth to occult
the goddess like a stone
among friends
worn smooth with
understanding.
To each part
the parts give way.

112

The Wharfinger

113

1.
Today from the permafrost
a germ reawakens, the million year
old day they run an old movie
Chaplin dashes
across the sea, what is an
index, the permanent
(nature has to be always contrary)
that dies again
we are carried
not beyond ourselves
but in spite of death, a flock of doves
returning to the scene of the crime
the world has to live again
some things
it’s February 17th
the ‘herald patch’
of my rash appears, I feel
414 years old we kiss in the doorway
and wonder what that meant.

114
2.
The curse is upon me
to figure, fill
the two sides of a form
to come in and el tunik
to vanish, that is also a cloth
the vanishing I wear to the world’s
cloth party, half-unknown
wearing one pantleg
to come in
is the only thing we think about
even if we don’t
a Spartan prologue
all the rest is about this
when years later you find me
in a red dress, coming in though
the back window
of my own house
as if that were the means to an end.

115
3.
We can only assume that stuff that bookends
syntax between the occulting legs of things, the wharf
we don’t know the land the sea
just the wharf we don’t suppose
it is too near, it is us
sallying forth the emissaries, those things
we hope to be true, the hand of a pick-pocket
the winedark forearm, the wharf as if it were the inversion
of what we don’t know, flat and wide
a misty dock, true but nothing clear
salt swoon of fish of secrets
the salt left by an obfuscation the suddenly alien
body is salt and the wrist a gull flaps above it
master of the wharf.

*
Washed up the salt carcass white dice
and the pink Himalayan salt, we are gamblers
the whale from the high mountains
something of truth clings to the wager of bone
despite it all the big talk what we
couldn’t pay out in heaven
we have gambled our way to an equivalent
loss as if that were the origin
but it is the origin that takes from us
the dragon in the sky, the earth hording
everything away again the
old pocket watch under the cloak of the obvious

116
under our very noses the cosmos
turning everything back into secrets
only the naive live here
the drunkard’s Latin
flashes of old pride how frequently
it’s too late when we remember.

117
4.
The gull is a knot in all the strings
the gull is all that’s yours
I want, all I want, and
errata, so sometimes
it’s not the gull at all, we pick
a word up from the root
see it wide from meaning
the gull of your hair, how can you
leave home me thinking this way of you?
gulls tucked in the suitor’s mirror
in you is your nature the gull
lest he spill back into the rest
like a sigh sits there
with boardwalk eyes
we think we know this of you
the place you are not
the world you remember
when the gull is gone.

118
5.
And if we turned the wharf inside out
would it be volumetric again? no
we must flatten, keep inverting
until the material, the painting
ground perfectly smooth, we put in
what it took
one grain at a time
unbuild or undwel
or any smaller step to dodge rationality
even rationality will do
so long as it’s medicine–
medicine? they’ve defined things
to rescind, no
we must build a mountain, one
self–canceling grain at a time
keep inverting, the high
mountains shimmering with maybe
the volumetric arms of the same god
will surprise us in this new flatness
and we may again not know what they’re doing.
(Because we still don’t understand
not everything has a consequence.)

for Gil

119
6.
We turn wharf back to
hwearfian, to turn, back
to Sanskrit surpam
winnowing fan, and from there
back to our quarters to dice
kartos the wrist again
the kind of winnowing you do
when the boss’ back is turned
and the body left
to its own devices
the translations trading lemons
for barrels full of salt
those little things we do
that keeps everything but us
the same like a wharf full of
hands pushing there pulling here.

120
7.
The wharf is nothing but candor
what was left when the wharf was swept clean
and the wharf, from old tackle and salt blue
rebuilds under everything that leaves
The Master of the Wharf opens
his windows in the morning
to examine the smoke rising from
chimney stacks with meteorologic
purpose, the trade winds
headed straight inland
even this silly place can learn
an olive skinned girl props open
her bedroom window for the green parrot
she looses a scroll
from its tail-feathers a radio traffic report
leaking from an old wooden boat
moored behind the square grey brick café
near St. Albans like an anchor from the sky to make sure
this place isn’t totally made up
but the remnant of some poet she looks
at a narrow street with paving stones
a soft light, newspapers or gulls
and an old chain tapping in the breeze
that lifts the gulls over her roof
and tickling her breasts in its passing
our lovers find us long before we know.

121
8.
We hate music anyway there’s instead
the deafness of going forward yes
I will tickle your breasts O
goddess of my sad loves sitting
like a battery under the lighthouse
the copper box under the street corner
the lapis palimpsest buried therein
of walking to the store and spilling
coffee on my coat, of walking toward
the store and going elsewhere, of doing
the right thing the palimpsest at the
beginning of every story a street-corner
full of stowaways of itching and uncomfortable
sweats yea the wharf must be wiped clean
because we always make the right decisions
according to us in universal harmony
there is a delicate balance a constant
reference to the books we every
day rewrite the palimpsests we consult
just to make sure of what it says.

122
9.
That said, words go on
separating out the four voices
leaving the fifth, the first
our bottom line; on second sight
the façade is curved a hyperbola
on the grid streets you, Madame Blavatsky
enter this architecture, reincarnated
manner brought back to surface
tease from the set what could define
another, whatever rises in this geometry
might bring the world to bear when I
am not me and the Wharfinger the
Master unnamable speaks through
everything I go to sit in my favorite
place spun in the currents of this syntax
where there hasn’t been a chair in 80 years
I walk into this world,
just open the door and it tells me
where to go, and who is I? the little shack
where the Wharfinger keeps his gear
the hooks and nets oddly godly
he keeps the wharf by such slender means.

123
10.
Not pressing in
but an intraocular pressure
cast out the images
eye-arrows
halo, the passage
& fleabane
phosphenes
on the field. The wharf
a world cast from the head
to find ourselves again: making the new things
old, the beginning of
the world
an endoptic phenomenon;
when the words come, before they’re
words, and we with nothing to say
start
Then the tide-tables learned behind
we learn to preposition them
the flow of this music
glues more than space
And drives back the explications
The tidal tide
An endoptic phenomenon
that presses back enough
it says, it’s time for you to see
an Oedipus ready to stop creating
Mother
the hunger sign
I learn to exchange for pleasure
An Oedipus ready to let the world back in.

124

11.
And finally we find a wisdom
it doesn’t have to do with introspection
because someone knows more
than the poet the poet
who says all we know, all we can know
even the Wisdom, its name
at hand we jump into the lake
hold that wisdom around us
seems a different tier of answer
(but what do we know)
by craft (not tricks) by
knowing too much
we rediscover the obvious a rubber
tipped crook for settling disputes
the thumb who reigns over the wrist
the unveiled crook of wisdom
pulls us from the lake
Inconsolable said Ginsburg.

125
12.
The wharf on the sea
a towel hung by the shower
we learn what the wharf is, live
under ideas from hole to hole
all that matters now is vantage and perhaps
our nearness to a restaurant
rats, lots of rats
and a few old gulls
all out of things to say the wharf
dangles over the great
vault of dormant know-how
a bus pulls up, two turtles overhead
as I was walking to the corner-store
things as they happen in their mercy
the wharf ordering the child with its song
from chaos’ brink! through a few merciful things
our oldest places weigh in again
through chains and hooks, towering
guano, an old dog, things belonging
to no one we’d never dream of taking home.

126

13.
Familiar as a wharf, place that turns
unknown
not contrariety but
evacuating the world
from itseself, a burning
building, the highway (from the gut)
any way that suits us
in the world to be free from it
before the familiar begins to plot
evacuating the word
leaving ourselves out there
to say what we come up with.

127

15.
To build a house from miles
of nets and trippery
and show a ship
really leaving this, to board up
any previous use of the function
a people wise at the smell of
fish, wise to the Noun of the wharf
and its disinheritings, sticks and leaves
giving way underfoot the thin covering
of a bottomless pit
pit can feel it draining from me
in approach, a wharf untenable
singularity ‘isn’t big enough
for the two of us’ and now the wharf
is just this place, where we leave to,
self-abandoning, when the wharf tires us out
a wharf between two
others . the defiance or the loss
of place, a New Providence
irrational (so they say) gamblers
striving back to what’s highest stakes
with us (something about leaving and
more gambling) the defiance or the loss
of place, leaving behind the imponderable
board up the bottomless pit, our wharf
is in Ocracoke, said Blackbeard, there
not a nouny old distrustful
we will find a shore (in North Carolina)

128

from which to never shore up again.

129
16.
All boarded up you stop looking
back stop informing your aesthetic
decisions stop having esthetic
decisions stop deciding
there never was a choice nor a
call for opinions no one has
proof read the opinions to
choose from no one healthy
considers the esthetics of
health, let us throw away the
old wharf for a new one expanding
out from between two things
the frame of the peripheral
where things really are,
let’s expand out from two
unnameables and not forget
this origin, two things
unclear no matter how fast you turn your head.

130

The Flats
1.
From in over the flats
of Great Barrington
we begin at the end of the road
taught to talk
to take
say the flats
up Mt.Washington
“There’s an old church.”
“There’s a blueberry farm.”
meaning from there
I haven’t seen yet
the meaning we are told
from the Tarot, a long blue
sword holding up the crown
singularity is simple
the tenderness of a sword
between breasts
this is the only
talk I know, I
heard about the
farm, will you accept
my love as taking it?
I have only this sword
for a road
show me something
and it goes into
the one singularity
the talk itself
and the rest one hopes to find there.

131

2.
Unraveling from the head a road
spoken ear tracts what you saw
there rebuilds the road drives
out from us the landscape, say
the old house with the illegible plaque
the sky an offering to the
sky voicing the said to its
own end where our sound becomes
illegible slipping under the horizon
the whisper of a name my
words have always wanted to say.
Sign’s demand, say what’s
on either side of you the farrago sighs
demand to be pulled in toward cadence, the song
of one sound, a word to make the others rhyme
up from the horizon
What horizon the Horus who comes into your house
from the marriage of the doorway
a chest at the foot of the bed where the sun
waits until morning we never stop traveling
“the matrices actually go supine” the brain lobes
fallen into the crest testicles
pulled into axis
a road going straight
our to sea, perhaps, and I, recently injured,
who can only sit and watch! and the road
at the end of it, the sea or the cause, I sit
at the end of day in a place not material
in the mightyness of what may be
the road a voice with a body at the end of it, what the
voice says, the melancholy fact of it.

132
3.
and I survive
although at times
“too descriptive”
giving myself away
a villa, a lime–tree
in the average grass
I say things
I can’t see, friends
I’ll never meet again
and Homer, blind
blind as a bat– we haven’t
traveled in poems since then
without saying we
see something, Keats knew
to say something
is to see, walk in light of
in the light of the said
saying the darkness
for the light of it
and vice versa
we walk under our sign
darkening pelvis
of hip folded to thigh
the sign of woman
slowly takes itself away
a word I musn’t speak
only back into the sign
a sign you can’t stare at too long
yet the body remembers
like Cadmon,
remembering

133

our first fact
morningflesh
on the other side of
words, too airy, early for them
and all there was to say there.
I survive by that remembrance
when I close my eyes and say
no one’s home, and there really isn’t
just the fudge you of bodies
and the song rising in them
the strange opera you know
when varying the sounds to perhaps
catch the real sound off guard
tease it out by syntax
by listening , that thing still in heaven
waiting to hear its name
However
name something and
The Fall or it does
until the name
eventually
goes flat again,
the thousand years it takes
to make a foot of earth. Twenty-six
million years of feet down is
a word from heaven that killed everything
with all its names.
The cheap rhetoric of using them
in conversation, as if the time had come.
The frogs.
or as I told someone
who did not remember but was
nonetheless glad to see me
“My travelogues are becoming quite

134

sparse, there is now almost
only the voice, a movement.”
“Oh, like Dream!” she said.
A mobility that is the desire
to emerge, lose the idiot
recalcitrant against the sea
against the obscurans
to move into the patterning of
life, the full emptiness of dream– the whole
spectrum of its emergence
like wearing out a pair of shoes
at the edge of the sea.

the two kinds of muscle
pushing the poem
one is learning
the signs, coming to them
as we drive, to say what’s there
about them
the other a conquistador
tells the sign our story
as a bid therein
for permanence, the sign
of us, overtaking the there (although
we had no idea what the conquistador was
doing
then, the prophetic idiot
in his sudden triumph, we didn’t understand
him
gleaming more fully in one’s own
presence than we’re used to
the prophet
overtakes the sign but also
is freed, hence an idiot
walking along some familiar path in a good mood
but without the you who knew it.
There, on a hill
and we couldn’t get him back. Then
(today) Coelridge said:
come across a polarity
find another polarity to
put it with.
Like you-know-what
I thought.
It became clear he meant
the sequence
remembers a geometrical postulate
by giving continuity to the disparate parts
an event is
and what is a single polarity
anyway but a fools pairing.

cart before the horse,
a song leaving us, posited
like a trail of breadcrumbs
you find your way home
to what’s in front of you
a story that’s common knowledge
the cart where we are born
Frankincense
field-grass
a pebble
these are the gifts of the wise men
one’s eyes open to them
a wise man
who forgot everything and is born
among wisdoms

Don’t open the box. Every story says so.
The scattered whole
when you open then box
and find everything that isn’t there.
But you do and in it is the story
stripped of its character, a concept
looking for its couple white bones
pine bough
and handkerchief.
The fire from which
fire appeared, and left behind everything
but itself
the road we take with us.

The Supplicant1
This letter may come to you as a surprise due to the fact that we have not yet met. Firstly,
I have to say that I have no intentions. My name is Mr. Lewis Smith, a European
merchant. My business in reach and thus in character finds itself largely Mediterranean:
although recent concerns for the distant relatives of a dear friend have led me to invest in
Sudanese lentils and the Zimbabwean Electrical Machinery sector; I have played key
background roles in several monarchic family weddings, besides supplying for them
spices, wine, food, raw materials, furs, cloth, glass, jewels, etcetera. Besides, or perhaps I
should say contiguous with my work as a mover of goods, a strong sense of the economic
current has developed in me. It is the secret success of a merchant to see the route to
which his items belong. To know where things want to go. Precisely this gift has created
as it was co-created with my practice my practice. Only by this talent of mine do I know
now to whom I write.
*
I sit here, writing to you in the dingy light of the forgotten apse of a sunken church.
Under red moons I scribble hurriedly from beneath the newest hedgerows. Or an old
bath-house bandied under its own weight, in what might be Bulgaria, from the wheattinted light I associate with Ovid’s Fasti. But I don’t know. I’ve come here not to. In the
place where there are no currents, besides that current which has led me, leads me still to
you.
*
I am the European merchant of nothing, just the sound of bicycles as they clatter along
the path skirting my shelter. It isn’t them I write you about. It isn’t the sound of bicycles
or the sweet morning flower who’s dew I ate a few hours ago, or the way I contrived to
sleep, naked in the hay. This is not what needs to be told you.

I mean Supplicant in the sense of a hermit or monk; a shrine marking the burial place of
same. Giving up of the flesh as something not one’s own is the catalyst for
metamorphosis. St. Paul perched like a bird on the rock sitting in the nest of his own hair.
By supplicant I mean that: the way Ovid encounters the metamorphosis of his fate.

A Devotee of The Process
I have hardly time to
talk now, he said, rearing
his eagle’s head
the bulky pyramid of his body
in that lazy old way below.
Just this then, he said
before you go catch the
bus– and he held a small polished
mirror up to his other head: a
Lion’s head. Quick, I said
what Is It. But he had become
a mirror and I ran off in the
fur of a lion.

AO
You may have her in the land
a world we have not yet thought
this is the work of the goddess
each year to be new--- isn’t that
what lizards tell us. The law of the land, that the land
enforce itself, teach us to read in us
its sign, a shadow here
an ankle, the collarbone leading into that
business of moonlight the body
we during day call You: this is the only
farming there is
the naked ploughman of Taurus
and the
woman one hand raised to heaven
who sends down a bolt of lightning.
This is the only food, a man following the woman he has mistaken for lightning.
Her one hand the air
the other ground--- man follows the seam of heaven
all other food is death.
He follows her, the lightning between her legs.
He has mistaken her for lightning--- not because he can’t explain
the phenomenon but he needs
her to triangulate
between these two nowheres.
To let him in. (Let the place of her come.)

‘‘For
‘‘For V.N.’’
V.N.’’ trans. T.P.
There were corked bottles
big keys, the whole sense
lay bare.
Before ever a window, before
a rattle, a glass, an eye
to be seen.
Curling strips
blind
swept, swayed
& my own sex glittered
in the cosmos.
Like the strings tied to
a shadow puppet
the old genitals, squint
impervious, lay
across the sky:
the truth, one’s writ
on earth’s forehead.

The Impasse

neighbor a small bowl in her hands in the
space between our houses she sneaks up on
hers throws black sludge on the giant
rhododendron that has now perhaps created
an impasse of her front door.
We don’t think a rhododendron
would do that but time, time, undemocratic
with our neglect makes even a flower
a door. What grows around
the house has followed us, be it from
Neolithic heaps or the blue shadow, the flower
of Goethe’s pencil: we can see
there’s a house around the house
flowers birdbaths ailanthus astral body
the part of us that touches the sky.
The flowers we put there.
Only through them can we get back in.

(CODA:

This temple door
to where a modest god
of my own size lives.
we survive through this thingly world.
Be suspicious of anything I hand you.
I’ve already tried to live in it.
I leave you the rock that couldn’t hold the blood of Isaac.
I live in what’s next. In what the line opens onto.
I wade in the shallows of the next thing you say.
