The photographer</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y1d ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">stood across a zouave who sat on his hands, his shapeless red trousers billowing like a</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y1a ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">lady’s skirt. The zouave tried to reason with the intruder in French. Andrew “Aha”</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y13 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">lurched against the wind, against the zouave’s insistent voice, and wrenched him from his</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y14 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">seat before tearing the curtain from the hospital’s wooden outer wall and ravaging the set</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y15 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">that Aloysius had devised.</div><div class="t m0 xd ha y16 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">But the decimation of the photographer’s quaint construction––––the wicker</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y17 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">boxes, the dirty fabrics, the rusted metal seat, a short belt of ammunition more decorative</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y1b ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">than intimidating––––earned him the soldier’s sympathies. His toil had seemed earnest</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y1e ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">and heartfelt, far from all the rules and stuffy theatrics of his assistant; and who was the</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y18 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">Ottoman, anyway, to tell that nice Englishman how to work his own machinery? The</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y19 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">soldiers, a bulk-boned lot, turned towards Andrew “Aha” as one but Aloysius raised a</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y1f ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">quelling palm, waited patiently for this convulsion’s end with the camera pressed against</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y20 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">his belly.</div><div class="t m0 xd ha y21 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">Andrew “Aha” stamped his feet. “He’s deranged, you idiots!” The soldiers looked</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y22 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">but weren’t listening.

It took him all of two minutes before</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y1e ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">he was on the floor of the bar again, face in the grime, spilled brew, boot-prints.

He smiled, “Ah!” as if surprised, and nodded. After</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y27 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">that, he drifted off with his thoughts and seemed no longer to notice her presence. Sophia</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y11 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">walked delicately, didn’t touch or offset anything she found, like the telescope that</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y12 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">waited by an open window, angled up towards the heavens. Outside the window, a</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y1d ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">gardener trimmed the hedges that lined the property with a pair of noisy shears. Sophia</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y1a ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">moved on before she could be spotted and peeked into the kitchen. A cook was preparing</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y13 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">a meal.

Surely checks would suffice, Sophia mused. But the servant went</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y17 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">on without any apparent confusion. They all did: everyone in the Meridian House seemed</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y1b ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">to go about his or her business inconspicuously––––strange, as though some unseen</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y1e ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">presence in the mansion should have forbade their untroubled acceptance of the tasks at</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y18 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">hand.</div><div class="t m0 xd ha y19 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">When she found the first hall of photographs, Sophia was initially reminded of the</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y1f ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">darkroom in the studio, every inch of its walls lined with pictures. But, completely</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y20 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">unfurnished, the hall she stepped inside was far larger than any darkroom’s cramped and</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y21 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">cluttered workspace. Images on glass, paper, and copper daguerreotypes covered the</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y22 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">walls from floor to ceiling, displayed every possible sight that she could imagine: open</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y23 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">landscapes, city streets, houses and gardens, interiors, faces, arms and legs, unclothed</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y24 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">bodies, animals both domesticated and exotic, alive and dead. Every plate was labeled</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y25 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">with the details.

She saw the closest apparition of the moon she had ever seen,</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y27 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">its cracks and craters exonerated from the obfuscation of earthly distance. Right next to it</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y11 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">was a pair of conjoined twins smiling straight into the lens. The next photograph showed</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y12 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">a man and a woman; her legs were open, he was hard and holding the base of his member</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y1d ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">as he entered her. Next to that was a human heart sitting on a scale. Two hundred and</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y1a ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">ninety grams, the scale said. Sophia felt a tremor in her chest.</div><div class="t m0 xd ha y13 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">She crossed into another empty hall.

She noticed then that not all the pictures bore the signature of Aloysius Overton</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y17 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">Adramalech. The hundreds of works hung in these rooms had been composed, she</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y1b ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">counted, by at least five different photographers.</div><div class="t m0 xd ha y1e ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">The third and fourth halls were similar in their immaculate arrangements. She</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y18 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">took her time crossing through, all but forgot that she was a trespasser in the house. It</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y19 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">was hard to look away, really––––the lack of classification among the pictures was at</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y1f ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">once wondrous and frustrating. One photograph belied any expectations over what</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y20 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sophia might find in the next. She thought of Genesis and the formless void before the</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y21 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">beginning, imagined what God must have felt every time he forged something new––––a</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y22 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">star, a seed, a morning, a man––––from the chaos of inception: joy in witnessing shapes</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y23 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">fight the darkness; a sense of prideful possession; but lastly the enduring hunch that any</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y24 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">possession was provisional, that already there were other forces at work––––ones he’d</div></div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>

Unlike the random arrangement of</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y11 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">images she had seen in the previous rooms, this one presented a completely panoramic</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y12 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">view of a city street, the photographs like mosaic tiles, arranged to depict a larger vision.</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y1d ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">The photographer must have taken a photograph, stepped to the side, and taken another,</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y1a ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">repeated this process hundreds of times, to achieve this effect. Sophia didn’t recognize</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y13 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">the location but a note in the doorway explained that the photographs portrayed the Place</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y14 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">de l&apos;Étoile, a sprawl of streets issuing from the Arc de Triomphe in Paris. The monument</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y15 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">itself was unseen––––it was as if the four walls accounted for the Arc’s own gaze, she</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y16 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">realized, each one providing a view north, south, east, or west. The project was still in the</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y17 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">making. The avenues that extended out from the Arc were incomplete, as was the</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y1b ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">sky––––cloudy in some photographs and clear in others––––that covered the hall’s</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y1e ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">ceiling. The white-painted wood of the mansion’s interior was revealed where streets</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y18 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">would finish, branches would extend from trees, buildings would stand and columns</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y19 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">would touch the earth that supported them. There was more to come.</div><div class="t m0 xd ha y1f ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">She couldn’t fathom the difficulty of this undertaking, the painstaking precision it</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y20 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">necessitated. Some of the photographs abided Parisians who had stood still long enough</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y21 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">to be captured by the camera. Perhaps more would join them, and people who had never</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y22 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">met, lived no mutual days, would share the same street; or perhaps this photographer’s</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y23 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">work would never end and he would revise these visions of the Place de l&apos;Étoile as it</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y24 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">changed over the years––––and Paris <span class="ff7">would</span>. London certainly had. The process would be</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y25 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">endless; though Sophia wondered if there might be a single spot in this scene––––a</div></div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>

The walls of the sixth held only a</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y12 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">few photographs. But Sophia instead chose the path of a purple carpet cut down a narrow</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y1d ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">corridor, into a sparsely furnished lounge––––just a fireplace, a table and two chairs. The</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y1a ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">staircase hugging the furthest wall struck Sophia as perfectly ordinary until she realized</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y13 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">that its steps continued up to the room’s ceiling without meeting any landing, any</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y14 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">entrance or exit, led to no conceivable room on the other side. There was, however, a</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y15 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">door built into the side of the staircase. She wondered what kind of man this Astronomer</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y16 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">Royal was, what secrets he locked away in lightless chambers, the corpses of old lovers,</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y17 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">house of Bluebeard or some legendary butcher. All normality was a presumption, Sophia</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y1b ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">knew; and all endeavors through it the breach of a chamber’s looming door.</div><div class="t m0 xd ha y1e ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">She turned the knob and pulled.

The door flapped an</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y19 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">inch or two before slamming shut. “Who’s there?” asked the man behind the door.</div><div class="t m0 xd ha y1f ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">Sophia stepped back.</div><div class="t m0 xd ha y20 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">“Who’s there?” he asked again as he turned a lock.</div><div class="t m0 xd ha y21 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">She swallowed. “My name is Mrs. Chambers, and I need to speak with you.”</div><div class="t m0 xd ha y22 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">A hesitation. Movement. “Why are you here?” Muted by the wall in front of him,</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y23 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">his voice was frail, thin, high-pitched, somewhat nasal, as if he were pulling his cheeks</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y24 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">and holding his nostrils shut.</div><div class="t m0 xd ha y25 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">“You can help me find my husband,” Sophia said.</div></div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>

When it began to move, De Paladines realized that the shape was a man</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y11 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">covered in soot, sitting on an empty crate, black and nearly blended into the scorched</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y12 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">heap behind him. “Ill est vivant!” one of the scouts shouted.</div><div class="t m0 xd ha y1d ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">De Paladines rode to the wreckage alone.

De</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y1f ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">Paladines waved the map in front of the man’s head but his attention was elusive.

Gregor made an</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y1f ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">indefinable sound. “Are you satisfied, sir?” asked the tailor, hands folded primly, after a</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y20 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">brief hesitation.</div><div class="t m0 xd ha y21 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">“I suppose it’s as well as I’ll do for the occasion,” Gregor said.</div><div class="t m0 xd ha y22 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">The tailor nodded, visibly relieved, and handed over the bill of sale and a brown</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y23 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">box containing his old suit. “If I may ask, what is the occasion?”</div><div class="t m0 xd ha y24 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">Gregor folded and pocketed the bill while staring at his reflection. “I’m going to</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y25 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">kill myself today.”</div></div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>

Silence overtook the room.</div><div class="t m0 xd ha y27 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">Gregor broke his gaze from the mirror. “I’m going to kill myself.

I’ll be a museum for you! A relic!” The tailor</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y17 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">wiped his brow and extended a quelling arm. Gregor shoved it aside. “And if you still</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y1b ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">want more, you’ll find me in the black forest with Pietro della Vigna by my side!

Conceivably, his death would earn an announcement over the telegraph,</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y21 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">whose invisible signals would carry him where his corpse could not.

He stood atop</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y24 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">the chair and straightened his homburg hat, grazed his fingertips through the cleft that ran</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y25 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">along the center of the crown, wanted to pull it apart, thought of Sophia’s child again.</div></div></div><div class="pi" data-data='{"ctm":[1.000000,0.000000,0.000000,1.000000,0.000000,0.000000]}'></div></div>

He took a last breath and stepped off the seat. A</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y27 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">raining gust of paint and plaster: the rope wrenched the fixture from the ceiling and</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y11 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">Gregor’s feet buckled when he landed, his knees absorbed the fall and his forehead struck</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y12 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">the hardwood floor. The fixture clanked beside him. He moaned, seized his skull, pain</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y1d ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">seared hot and cold, tears escaped his eyes. His neck burned. He lay there for an hour,</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y1a ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">barely changing his position.</div><div class="t m0 xd ha y13 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">When he finally tried to stand he was cautious, his ankles ached though nothing</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y14 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">felt broken, the fall was only a couple of feet but his body was in agony.

The bone was bruised. Perhaps another day</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y19 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">would be his day to die. Who could say when? It was impossible to tell, and expectations</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y1f ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">could be treacherous. Drowsy and despondent, he wondered what lay ahead.</div><div class="t m0 xd ha y20 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">Flecks of plaster littered his suit. He supposed he didn’t need it anymore. He</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y21 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">removed the bill of sale from his pocket. Hopefully the tailor’s shop was still open for</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y22 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">business.

He looked terrified;</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y13 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">then, as the tailor focused his eyes, he discerned the mess of plaster that spoiled the new</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y14 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">suit, the bent and misshapen homburg hat, the bruise on the old man’s forehead, the</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y15 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">crimson burn encircling his neck. Resolute, the tailor shook his head, muttered to himself,</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y16 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">Gregor couldn’t hear him but the movements of his mouth were unmistakably bitter. The</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y17 ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">tailor grabbed a white sign laced with string and hung it from a nail over the other side of</div><div class="t m0 x0 ha y1b ff6 fs2 fc1 sc0 ls0 ws0">the glass.
