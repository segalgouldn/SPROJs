Abstract
Direct laser writing (DLW) lithography is a useful way to generate microscopic patterns
for lab-on-a-chip devices. We have developed a simple and inexpensive platform for the
creation of these initial patterns using a homemade acrylic resin, a 405-nm laser diode,
and a fluorescence microscope. To create sub-micrometer linewidths, we included a radical
scavenger in the photoresist to quench excessive amounts of radicals generated from laser
exposure. In this project, we compared various formulations of the photoresist and we
presented a model for the radical polymerization in our photoresist. The model utilized the
method of finite differences to numerically solve a system of parabolic partial differential
equations describing the diffusive behaviors of particles in the photoresist. The model also
made use of Markov chains to simulate the step-wise polymerization of the photoresist.
The parameters in the model were determined by fitting the model on experimentallyobtained data.

Chapter 1
Introduction I
The rapid development of science and technology has demanded the construction of
smaller and smaller structures for various reasons. In the realm of computer engineering,
Moore’s Law [Moo65], proposed in 1965, accurately predicted that the number of transistors on an integrated circuit would double approximately every two years. In order for
millions and even billions of transistors to be created on a single chip, their size has to be
miniature. The shrinking of electronics components and their integration into complex
circuits have enabled the creation of modern electronics and the age of information.
A similar miniaturization revolution is underway in the physical sciences. First predicted by the physicist Richard Feynman in his famous “There’s plenty of room at the
bottom” lecture, Feynman explains the basic tenets of nanotechnology. The fields of
chemistry and biology are joining physics and the electronics industry in trying to make
technologies smaller, faster, and cheaper. For example, the assays on micro-biological
2

structures require testing chambers of the size comparable to a single bacterium or a
red blood cell [ZNWS13, TBP+ 11], which is usually in micrometer scale. The demands
on micro-structures from biological sciences have given rise to the development of micro
total analysis systems (µTAS) [KOM+ 13], which integrate the functionalities of multiple
chemical assays into one single chip. Such devices are known as “lab-on-a-chip” (LOC)
for their capability to perform various chemical tests and their ability to operate assays
using only picoliters of sample.
The use of micro-scale devices is constantly increasing in chemistry and biology, and so
the study of new fabrication techniques is an ever evolving and important field. Nowadays
in electronics industry, photolithography has become one of the most commonly-applied
techniques for microfabrication [Jae02]. It uses a mask to expose the surface of a layer
of photoresist selectively by ultraviolet (UV) light, chemically changing the photoresist
such that the exposed area is more or less soluble than the unexposed area. After development in a solvent, a two-dimensional pattern is left on the substrate. With multiple
runs of such processes, a complicated circuit system can be “drawn” on the substrate.
Besides photolithography, other techniques for the fabrication of micro-structures include
electron beam lithography [RC97], dynamic masking [IKT+ 08], high precision machining
[ZRM+ 03], and direct laser writing. One of the main distinctions between these mothods
and conventional mask-based lithography is their serial nature compared to the parallel
nature of masks.

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION I

Photolithography

Conventional mask-based photolithography is widely practiced in contemporary electronics industry. A series of sophisticated manipulations are performed under highlyregulated conditions [Jae02] to produce integrated circuits that go into commercial computer chips and processors.
The whole process of photolithography takes place in a clean room. It transfers patterns from masks to photoresist on the surface of silicon wafers. Commertial chips are
mostly produced on silicon wafers with positive photoresists, in which case the area exposed under UV light turns soluable and can be washed off by solvents. In the subsequent
etching or doping steps, the photoresist protects portions of the surface while windows
are etched in barrier layer such as silicon dioxide, silicon nitride, or metal. After etching, the photoresist is removed, and impurities can be introduced into the wafer through
the windows, or metal can be deposited on the surface making contact with the silicon
through the etched windows.
Photolithography requires the use of photomasks at the ultraviolet exposure step.
One photomask gives only a specific pattern on the wafer, while that pattern may contain
millions of features that are all made in parallel. Multiple photomasks are required for
different structures drawn on the substrate, which could be inconvenient and expensive.
Hence, some maskless alternatives have been developed to overcome the drawbacks of
photolithography.

Direct Laser Writing (DLW)

Direct laser writing (DLW) is an effective way to fabricate micro-structures without
a mask. It uses a moving laser to initiate a change in the solubility of the photoresist to
achieve its goal. Similar with those in photolithography, the photoresists used in DLW
can be either positive or negative. Usually in DLW, a negative photoresist consists of at
least a monomer and a photoinitiator. The photoinitiator absorbs photonic energy from
the laser, breaks apart into radicals, and initiates the polymerization process. Depending
on the type of photonic absorption by the photoinitiator, DLW can be categorized into
two major branches: one-photon DLW and two-photon DLW. The free radicals generated
by the photoinitiator subsequently trigger the polymerization reaction of the monomers,
which will be further discussed in section 1.3.

1.2.1

One-photon DLW

Photoinitiators are usually capable of homolytic cleavage at one or more of its chemical bonds, resulting in the formation of free radicals (Figure 1.1). When a photoinitiator
molecule absorbs a photon with a specific range of wavelengths, the molecule is excited
from the ground state (S0 ) to an excited electronic state (S1∗ ). The molecule then undergoes non-radiative relaxation into the vibrational ground state of the first excited state
(S1 ). Intersystem crossing (ISC) occurs at this moment to bring the molecule from a
singlet state (S1 ) to a triplet state (T1 ). The molecules in the triplet state are clasically

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION I

forbidden to make the transition back to the ground state, which makes the lifetime of
excited molecules long enough to yield free radicals.

1.2.2

Two-photon DLW

Normally, a molecule absorbs only one photon to make transitions between its electronic states. However, when two photons hit a molecule simultaneously (which rarely
happens in nature because the photon intensity required is extremenly high), the molecule
is able to make a transition to an excited state with an energy gap corresponding to the
energy sum of these two photons [Abe62]. Such a process is usually achieved with pulsed
lasers, which produces pulses with high intensity. The highly intense laser pulses make
two-photon absorption possible in a tiny volume element, or voxel, at the focal point of the
laser, thus generating a limited amount of free radicals that are only able to polymerize
the photoresist at this small scale.

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION I

1.2.3

Comparisons between the two types of DLW

In contemporary research labs, both one-photon DLW and two-photon DLW techniques are practiced for their distinctive advantages over one another.
Two-photon DLW gives structures with smaller linewidths and resolution comparing
to one-photon DLW. When the laser beam is focused on the surface of the substrate
(Figure 1.2), it goes through the photoresist, and the intensity of the beam decreases
proportional to the square of the distance from the focal point. In one-photon DLW, a
large range of beam intensity is capable for photoinitiation and polymerization. Even a low
beam intensity leads to a low concentration of free radicals, which may not reach the level
required for polymerization, but enough to generate oligomers that turns into polymer
more easily and more rapidly than unexposed photoresist. However, in two-photon DLW,
the beam intensity plays an important role in the initiation process. For two photons
to reach one photoinitiator molecule simultaneously, a high intensity of the laser beam

beam intensity

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION I

is required. Such high intensity is only attained near the focal point, while further away
from the focal point, the probability for two photons to reach the same molecule at the
same time is essentially zero. Thus the free radicals are only generated within a short
distance of the focus but not deep into the photoresist. The highly-localized radicals in
two-photon DLW yield smaller structures with higher resolutions than one-photon DLW
does.
However, the cost for a pulsed laser used in two-photon DLW is much higher than that
of a continuous wave laser. A femtosecond titanium:sapphire laser used in two-photon
DLW costs more than $100,000 together with a 532-nm pump laser, while a 405-nm laser
diode module is available at $185 on ThorLabsr .

1.3

Acrylic Ester Polymerization

Acrylic esters (Figure 1.3) are the most commonly-used monomers in DLW photoresists. They undergo radical polymerization when a photoinitiator is used to generate
radicals. The reaction mechanism is shown in Figure 1.4.

Figure 1.3: Acrylic Acid and Acrylic esters

The introduction of multiple acrylate groups in the R chain of the acrylic ester molecule
leads to branching and cross-linking of polymer chains, thus enhancing the strength and

rigidity of the polymer. Substances with multiple acrylate groups are often used in DLW
as the monomer [FW13].

1.4

Memory Effect

As shown in Figure 1.2, the beam intensity decreases as the laser beam goes deeper
into the photoresist. The beam intensity reaches its maximum at the focus, promoting

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION I

10

Figure 1.5: An example of “memory effect”, where the lines are drawn from top to bottom
the radical initiation at that point, but photons are also absorbed beyond the focal point.
The concentration of initiated free radicals beyond the focal point may not be high enough
to propagate the growth of long-chain polymers, but the generated radicals do not die
off immediately, and the oligomer molecules linger. The lifetime of the radicals is long
enough to affect the subsequent exposures nearby, resulting in an increase in linewidth
of the structures (Figure 1.5). Additionally, the photoresist, while quite viscous, does
allow for diffusion of radicals, and the reflection of the laser beam within the photoresist
also leads to higher-order exposure. The diffusion of radicals and smaller oligomers made
unintentionally beyond the focal point affect the resolution of DLW, and thus prohibit
the fabrication of structures as small or as close to each other as we wish. Since it usually
appears to us that the photoresist somehow “remembers” previous laser exposures and

CHAPTER 1. INTRODUCTION I

11

affects nearby structures fabricated a short time later, we have named this phenomenon
the “memory effect”.

1.5

Radical Inhibition

Radical scavengers are commonly used in chemistry in order to remove or deactivate unwanted reaction products in a mixture. For example, butylated hydroxytoluene
(BHT) is usually added to the stock of diethyl ether as an inhibitor [Sig13] to prevent the
formation of explosive diethyl ether hydroperoxide, which reacts via a radical pathway.

Figure 1.6: The Mechanism for Radical Inhibition with BHT

The polymerization of monomers depends on the concentration of free radicals in
the photoresist, and here is where the idea of inhibition comes from. One-photon DLW
creates unwanted free radicals and unpolymerized oligomer molecules beyond the focal
point after each exposure. If radical scavengers are added into the photoresist, they will
be able to quench the free radicals, thus preventing further polymerization involving these
free radicals and improving linewidth and resolution in one-photon DLW.

Chapter 2
Experimental Overview
The fabrication of micro-scale structures is carried out with a systematic procedure.
The procedure starts from modifying glass slides or coverslips. Acrylate groups are attached to the surface of the glass substrate so that the polymerized photoresist may bond
tightly to the glass surface. The photoresist in our experiments consists of three substances - the monomer, photoinitiator, and the radical scavenger. When a collimated
laser beam is focused onto the photoresist, the photoinitiator is excited and turns into
radicals, initiating the radical polymerization process as shown in Figure 1.4. The laser
beam is filtered and collimated by a series of optics carefully positioned on an optical
table equipped with vibration isolation system. The glass slide with photoresist is fixed
on an automated stage that moves in the plane perpendicular to the laser beam. Polymer
structures are fabricated by moving the stage relative to the laser beam, leaving polymers
attached on the modified glass surface.

In the following sections, descriptions of each experimental procedure and apparatuses
in use are provided in detail.

2.1

Laser Setup

A laser diode module (CPS405, ThorLabs, USA) is used throughout our experiments.
It produces a 405-nm, 4.5-mW elliptical beam. However, a collimated circular beam is
desired for our purposes. Therefore, two converging lenses and a pinhole are installed together with a few other optical equipments to modulate the beam, as shown in Figure 2.1.

The beam coming out of the laser diode is plane polarized. The half-wave plate is
a birefringent crystal that rotates the plane of polarization when the crystal is rotated.
Different polarization of the beam results in different amount of reflection from the polarizing beam splitter. The combination of these two pieces of equipment allows us to
efficiently control the power output by rotating the half-wave plate.

CHAPTER 2. EXPERIMENTAL OVERVIEW

The lenses in this system are placed in a way such that the principle axes of the two
lenses align with the center of the laser beam, and the distance between them equals
the sum of their focal distance. In this fashion, a telescope that expands and collimates
the beam is created. A pinhole of diameter 10 µm is placed at the common focal point
of the lenses. This pinhole acts as a spatial filter to remove unwanted transverse laser
modes. This arrangement results in an output pattern of an Airy disk [Air35, ST91].
The intensity of the Airy disk is symmetric around its center, and the relation between
the intensity and the distance from the center can be expressed in terms of the Bessel
function:

I(θ) = I0

2J1 (ka sin θ)

,

where I0 is the intensity at the center, k = 2π/λ is the wavenumber, a is the radius of the
pinhole, and J1 is the Bessel function of the first kind of order one. If we let x = ka sin θ,
and plot I(x)/I0 , we may discover that it resembles the curve for a Gaussian function
(Figure 2.2). In fact, in Part II of this project, we are going to approximate the laser
beam as a Gaussian beam. All the results of mathematical modeling in this project are
based on this approximation.
Once the laser beam passes through the lenses and the pinhole, it is considered nicely
circular and collimated. The beam is now ready to enter the microscope for DLW. The
periscope unit consists of two mirrors that change the direction of the beam and send it
up into the microscope.

oil objective, which we will discuss further in Section 2.5. A picture of the complete DLW
setup is taken and shown below in Figure 2.4.

The sample is fixed on an automated stage, which moves in the plane perpendicular
to the principle axis of the laser beam. When the laser beam is turned on, polymerization
of the photoresist occurs at the spot of exposure. If the automated stage is moving at the
same time, a trace of polymerized photoresist shows up on the path in which the focal
point of the laser beam moves relative to the sample. A series of planar structures can
be fabricated by pre-programming the moves of the stage with a graphical user interface,
which will be further discussed in Section 2.5.

CHAPTER 2. EXPERIMENTAL OVERVIEW

Photoresist

The photoresists that we used throughout the experiments consists of an acrylic ester
(monomer), a photoinitiator, and an inhibitor. As described in Sections 1.2, 1.3, and
1.5, the photoinitiator absorbs photonic energy from the laser and turns into radicals.
The radicals propagate to form polymer chains as they react with the carbon-carbon
double bonds in the acrylate groups. The inhibitor in the photoresist prevents “overpolymerization” by quenching the excessive free radicals generated by photoinitiation.

2.3.1

Composition

The structures of the three components of the photoresist are shown in Figure 2.5.
The majority (≥ 95%) of the photoresist is composed of the acrylate monomer, which,
in our experiments, is dipentaerythritol-pentaacrylate (SR-399) (Sartomer, USA). The
photo-initiator used is Lucirinr TPO-L (BASF, Germany). We control the concentration
of the photo-initiator to be 1%. Trial experiments have shown that this concentration
works the best for a wide ranges of exposure dose, as well as both our objective lenses. Dif-

ferent concentrations (0 ∼ 4%) of radical scavenger 2-tert-butyl-4-methylphenol (tBMP)
(Sigma-Aldrich, USA) were also added into the photoresist as the inhibitor.

2.3.2

Preparation

Four types of photoresists with different concentrations of tBMP are prepared according to the mass percentage listed in Table 2.1. Notice that the most significant difference
among them is the concentration of tBMP. In later experiments, we will investigate the
effects of inhibitor on different properties in DLW.

Table 2.1: Composition (Mass Percent) of Different Photoresists

Because the photo-initiator is photo-sensitive, the preparation of each photoresist is
carried out in a dark room. A light-insulating bottle is made by covering the surface
of a 20-mL glass vial with aluminum foil as the container for the photoresist. After all
compounds are weighed properly and added into the bottle, the mixture is heated to
80 ∼ 90◦ C. By reaching this temperature range, tBMP melts in the mixture, and the
viscosity of the mixture is reduced dramatically for better mixing. At this time, a wooden

CHAPTER 2. EXPERIMENTAL OVERVIEW

19

applicator is used to mix the components. The photoresist is then cooled in a hood and
is ready for use after it gets back to room temperature.

2.4

Modified Glass Slides or Coverslips

Glass is made from silicate salts, and silicate is usually not a good substrate for
microfabrication because of its low affinity for acrylate polymers. However, if we perform
a modification on the glass surface, the acrylate polymer will attach covalently to the
glass surface, resulting in permanent structures on the glass.
Clean, dry glass slides or coverslips (1 in × 1 in) are cleaned in an air plasma (Harrick
Scientific model PDC-32G) for 5 minutes, and then placed in a solution containing 2%
(3-acryloxypropyl)-trimethoxysilane (Gelest, USA), 3% water, and 95% ethanol (Sigma
Aldrich, USA) for 6 hours with constant stirring. The acrylate-modified coverslips are
then rinsed with ethanol twice, dried with nitrogen gas, and heated in an oven at 100◦ C
for 20 minutes. At this point, the surface of the glass slides or coverslips is covered with a
layer of acrylate groups. When polymers form under laser exposures, the polymer chains
bond to the acrylate groups, leaving tightly bonded structures on the glass surface.

2.5

Constructing a Micro-Scale Structure

A sample for DLW is prepared by placing a drop of photoresist between a clean, dry
microscope slide (3 in × 1 in) and an acrylate modified glass surface. Depending on the

CHAPTER 2. EXPERIMENTAL OVERVIEW

20

structure we desire to construct, we may use a modified glass slide or coverslip. The
difference between these two types of substrates and fabrication techniques are discussed
in the following subsections.

2.5.1

Fabrication using the 4× objective lens (NA = 0.10)

Both modified glass slides and coverslips work for this setup. The sample for DLW is
fixed on the automated stage above the objective lens. The automated stage, together
with the shutter in front of the laser diode, is controlled by a program (ProScan GUI,
Miles Ingram) on a computer. Desired structures can be programmed and fabricated
automatically with the program. The moving speed of the photonic exposure can be
programmed as the moving speed of the automated stage. The power output of the laser
diode can be controlled with the half-wave plate and the polarizing beam splitter (Section
2.1). An effective power for DLW with 4× objective lens ranges from 1 µW to 500 µW,
depending on the fabrication speed.

2.5.2

Fabrication using the 40× oil objective lens (NA = 1.30)

Only modified coverslips work for this setup. Before one starts to fabricate any structure with the 40× objective lens, a drop of index matched immersion oil must be applied
to the objective lens. The oil drop then comes into contact with both the lens and the
sample on the side of the coverslip. A glass slide cannot be used with this objective
because the focal distance of the objective lens is smaller than the thickness of the glass

CHAPTER 2. EXPERIMENTAL OVERVIEW

21

slide. Structures with much small dimension can be fabricated with the same program as
the one we used for 4× objective lens. An effective power for DLW with 40× oil objective
lens ranges from 50 nW to 300 nW, depending on both the fabrication speed and the
complexity of the structure.

Figure 2.6: A hybrid structure using both objectives

Hybrid structures can be fabricated by combining the advantages of both lenses. A
typical size for DLW with the 4× objective is 50 ∼ 100 µm, while that with the 40× oil
objective is 1 ∼ 3 µm. The general shape of a structure can be first constructed with the
4× objective, and then the delicate details may be added with the 40× oil objective. An
electron micrograph of a successful example is shown in Figure 2.6.

CHAPTER 2. EXPERIMENTAL OVERVIEW

2.6

22

Developing a Micro-Scale Structure

After the desired structure is successfully fabricated with the pre-programmed commands, the DLW sample is removed from the automated stage. If it just underwent
40× fabrication, the index matched immersion oil should be wiped off the coverslip with
hexanes. The sample is then submerged in ethanol for 10 minutes to dissolve the unpolymerized photoresist. The substrate is carefully separated with the microscope slide,
and is further rinsed by ethanol and methanol. After drying the DLW sample with gentle
flow of air, the structure is ready to be used for further steps including scanning electron
microscopy (SEM) imaging, microfluidics, and soft lithography.

2.7

Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM)

Before sending the fabricated sample to the SEM, a 20-nm layer of gold is sputter
coated (Cressington, Model 108 Sputter Coater) to the surface of the sample so that the
surface becomes electrically conductive. The sample is then imaged and measured using
a field emission scanning electron microscope (Tescan MIRA 3).

Chapter 3
Shrinkage Study
We notice that the acrylate polymer shrinks in size during the alcohol-rinsing process.
Such shrinkage may affect the accuracy in further studies on memory effect. We also
notice that the shrinkage of the polymer depends on the concentration of the inhibitor.
As shown in Figure 3.1, the polymer created with the inhibitor-containing photoresist
exhibits more significant shrinkage than the other. Here we present a set of methods to
quantitatively characterize the shrinkage of the acrylate polymer.

CHAPTER 3. SHRINKAGE STUDY

Methods

A sample for DLW was prepared as described in Section 2.5. With the 4× objective
lens, a set of lines with different linewidths ranging from 50 µm to 200 µm was fabricated
(100 µW, 500 µm/s) on the modified coverslip. The linewidths of the lines were first
measured under the optical microscope before rinsing. After the first round of measurements, the sample was rinsed with alcohols and dried over blowing nitrogen gas. It is then
sputter-coated and sent to the SEM for measurements after alcohol developing. Two sets
of measurements were tabulated and compared to obtain the shrinkage coefficient for the
photoresist. The process was repeated with four different photoresists.
Near the surface of the modified coverslip, the shrinkage behavior is restricted because
the polymer chains are bonded to the acrylate groups on the surface of glass. We introduce
a new method to characterize the shrinkage coefficients of the photoresists. The data
obtained by this method are of more interst to this project because most of the following
experiments are carried out with 40× oil lens, and so is this method.
A sample for DLW was prepared as described in Section 2.5. With the 40× oil objective
lens, four columns of dimension 10 × 10 × 10 µm were fabricated (80 nW, 50 µm/s) layer
by layer with different focal depth. The columns were then connected with two singlepass DLW at 10 µm above the surface of coverslip, forming a cross in the middle of the
structure. A 10-by-10-µm grid of lines was subsequently drawn on the cross to yield a
waffle-like structure floating in the center. A 3-D presentation of the structure is shown

CHAPTER 3. SHRINKAGE STUDY

25

in Figure 3.2. The sample was then rinsed with alcohols and dried carefully by letting the
alcohols evaporate. As the alcohols evaporated away, the waffle structure was pulled onto
the surface of the glass due to surface tension of the remaining fluid. After the sample
was completely dried, it was sent for sputter-coating and SEM imaging to determine the
dimension of the waffle structure after alcohol developing.

Results

The results are generally consistent with our conjecture. We present the results from
different methods in two separate subsections.

The measured linewidths before and after alcohol developing are tabulated in Table A.1

the linewidth after (Figure A.1 – A.4). The slope of the plot indicates the proportion of
remaining linewidth, which can be used to calculate percent shrinkage of each photoresist
(Table 3.1).

The highly concentrated exposure dose for fabricating the structure illustrated in Figure 3.3a gave rise to troubles in measuring the actual dimension of the waffle structure
because the central structure had increased in size due to memory effect (Section 1.4).
Fortunately, the polymer retained its waffle-like texture so that we were able to measure

Discussion

The measurements with both 4× and 40× objective lenses showed that the percent
shrinkage increases as the concentration of inhibitor in the photoresist increases. This
conclusion explained the different appearance of polymers under the same fabricating
conditions with different photoresists (Figure 3.1).
The results obtained from the 4× air objective lens appeared to be more controversial.
The percent shrinkage of the first three photoresists are close in range (12% - 14%).
However, there were more systematic errors involved in this method: (1) the shrinking
restriction and (2) the power dependence.
The polymers fabricated with 4× lens bond to the surface of the glass, preventing
it from shrinking near the base. In the 40× case, the polymers to be measured were
fabricated without contacting the surface of the glass, and thus able to shrink evenly in
all directions.
The precent shrinkage also appeared to be power-dependent in the 4× case. For
instance, the separated branches in the plot for photoresist #1 (Figure A.1) were the
outcome of changing the laser power (from 10 µW to 100 µW) during the experiment.
However, the percent shrinkage is less power-dependent in the 40× case because the useful
power range for 40× oil fabrication (50 nW ∼ 300 nW, see Chapter 4) is much narrower
than that for 4× fabrication.

Chapter 4
Linewidth Characterization
One of the most fundamental and most useful structure for DLW lithography is a
straight line. In this chapter, we present a study on the properties of straight lines
fabricated from DLW under different conditions. We used different laser powers, writing
speeds, and inhibitor concentrations, and compared the linewidths under these conditions.
The results gives a table of reference for future fabrication of lines with desired linewidth.

4.1

Methods

A sample for DLW was prepared as described in Section 2.5. A straight line was
first drawn on the coverslip while adjusting the z-coordinate in order to align the focal
point of the laser with the surface of the coverslip. A set of five straight lines with a
specific power-speed combination was drawn 100 µm away from the focus-adjustment line

29

CHAPTER 4. LINEWIDTH CHARACTERIZATION

30

in order to prevent significant memory effects. The sample was developed and sputtercoated, then sent for SEM imaging as described in Sections 2.6 and 2.7. An SEM image
of the fabricated straight lines is shown in Figure 4.1. Such process was repeated for all
the power-speed combinations for the following choices of laser powers and writing speeds
in Table 4.1. The measured linewidth under each condition is tabulated and compared
for the analysis of the linewidth’s dependence on different conditions.

In order to reduce the unexpected variations during the fabrication, and to save the
usage of modified coverslips, all the sixteen combinations were operated on one sample.
Then the same combinations were repeated for the other photoresists. In the end, we
obtained a total of 64 sets of lines for linewidth measurements.

4.2

Results

The raw data of linewidth measurements on the 64 sets of lines are tabulated in
Appendix B. The “not available” (N/A) data points are conditions under which linear
fabrication was difficult, if not impossible, due to low laser power and/or high writing
speed. The average linewidths obtained from different fabricating conditions are tabulated
in Table B.5. A more viewer-friendly colored chart is also provided as Figure 4.2 on the
following page with the numbers showing the linewidths under the according fabricating
conditions.

4.3

Discussion

The colored chart provides a clear pattern within the data. The linewidth of DLW
depends on laser power, writing speed, and inhibitor concentration in the photoresist. In
all four photoresists, the color of the blocks turns “colder” as we go down the rows for
higher laser power, and turns “warmer” as we go right of the columns for faster writing
speed. As we increase the inhibitor concentration, the color of the chart turns “warmer”.

The colored chart provides a table of reference for future fabrications of lines with desired
linewidth.

4.3.1

Laser power/writing speed dependence

Generally in the colored chart, as we go down each row, the color of the blocks turns
“colder”, and the linewidth increases. It makes sense that thicker lines are fabricated with
higher laser power.
All the rows in the colored chart have linewidth value decreasing from left to right.
Thus the linewidth decreases as we increase the writing speed, because the exposure dose
is reduced in a unit area with a faster speed.

4.3.2

Inhibitor concentration dependence

The general picture shows that the color of the charts turns “warmer” as the concentration of inhibitor is increased. Here we compare the linewidths under one power-speed
combination for four different photoresists to illustrate the inhibitor’s affects on DLW
linewidth. Figure 4.3 shows the average linewidths of straight lines fabricated under 150
nW laser power and 20 µm/s writing speed with four different photoresists. As we may
tell from the figure, the average linewidth measured from the SEM image decreases with
an increasing inhibitor concentration. However, we are more interested in the linewidths
before shrinkage, which can be calculated with the shrinkage coefficient determined in
Section 3.2. The linewidth before shrinkage for each photoresist is tabulated in Table 4.2,

Part II
Mathematical Modeling

Chapter 5
Introduction II
One of the most important concerns in the area of direct laser writing (DLW) lithography is the spatial resolution. However, the spatial resolution of DLW lighography is
affected by the memory effect. The diffusive behavior of the photoresist prohibits structures from being fabricated close to each other. The heat equation, which is classified as
a parabolic partial differential equation, describes the heat flow or diffusion processes. A
simple example of the heat equation in one-dimension is given by
∂2
∂
u(x, t) = α · 2 u(x, t),
∂t
∂x

(5.1)

where u(x, t) is a function of space x and time t that describes the concentration of a
specific molecule in a heterogeneous mixture, where α > 0 is the diffusivity coefficient.
Previous research showed the utility of heat equations in this type of modeling [PY05].
We assume that the diffusion of the particles, including the monomer, photoinitiator, and
36

CHAPTER 5. INTRODUCTION II

37

free radicals, behave according to an analog of the heat equation. Therefore, it is natural
to start with the heat equation and develop a mathematical model for the polymerization
of the photoresist.
However, a PDE does not always have analytic solutions [Rub74]. In order to obtain
numerical approximations of the solutions to PDEs, the method of finite differences is used
to discretize the continuous partial differential equations into difference equations. The
difference equations can then be iteratively solved with appropriate initial and boundary
conditions with the help of mathematical programming languages.
Additionally, we use Markov chains to model the growth of the polymer. Similar
approach had been applied in the modeling of actin polymerization [Sza10]. A Markov
chain is a deterministic probabilistic model with a finite number of states {si }ni=1 and
transition probabilities {pij | 1 ≤ i, j ≤ n} between states si and sj . The Markov
process assumes that the conditional probability distribution of future states of the process
depends only upon the present state, not on the sequence of events that preceded it. The
Markov model gives a probabilistic distribution of states at any given number of time
steps [Rev84].

5.1

The Gaussian Beam

Before we start modeling the polymerization reaction, we study the profile of the laser
setup. In Section 2.1, we proposed that the intensity of the collimated laser beam follows

CHAPTER 5. INTRODUCTION II

38

the pattern of an Airy disk, which can be approximated by a Gaussian function. The
beam can therefore be approximated as a Gaussian beam (Section 2.1 and Figure 2.2).
We shall present some useful properties of the Gaussian beam [ST91].
The optical intensity of a focused Gaussian beam I(r) is a function of the axial and
radial distances, z and ρ =

p
x2 + y 2 , respectively. The expression is given by

(5.3)

where z0 is called the Raleigh range, and is the axial distance at which the intensity is
half of I0 along the beam axis.
Two additional properties of the Gaussian beam used in developing the model are the
beam divergence and the depth of focus. Far from the beam center, when z  z0 , the
beam radius increases approximately linearly. This fact can be verified by examing the
beam radius function W (z). By algebraic manipulation, we may get the relation
W (z)2 z 2
− 2 = 1,
W02
z0

(5.4)

which implies that W (z) is the positive branch of a pair of hyperbolae. The plot of W (z),
therefore, has a pair of linear asymptotes (Figure 5.1), which defines a half-angle. About
86% of the beam power is confined with a cone defined by the half-angle θ0 [ST91]. The

(5.5)

The beam divergence is inversely proportional to the beam-waist diameter 2W0 . Thus if
we want to squeeze the beam waist to produce a smaller DLW voxel, a larger θ0 should
be used by using a lens with high numerical aperture (NA).
The Gaussian beam achieves its best focus at the plane z = 0. In either direction, the
beam gradually grows “out of focus.” The axial distance within which the beam radius
lies within a factor of

√
2 of its minimum value is known as the depth of focus or confocal

parameter, and is twice the Rayleigh range,

Parabolic Equations

To describe diffusive behaviors of particles, we need parabolic-type partial differential
equations. First we shall have some definitions [Far82].

CHAPTER 5. INTRODUCTION II

41

Definition 1. A partial differential equation, abbreviated as PDE, is an equation
that contains partial derivatives.
Let u(x, y) be a function of x and y. Listed below are some examples of partial
differential equations.
∂u

∂x

∂ 2u ∂ 2u

For notational simplicity, we would denote the partial derivatives using subscripts as
follows

uy =

uxx =

∂ 2u

∂x2

uyy =

∂ 2u
.
∂y 2

Definition 2. Let u(x, y) be a function of two variables x and y. A second-order linear
PDE in two variables is an equation in the form
Auxx + Buxy + Cuyy + Dux + Euy + F u = G,
where A, B, C, D, E, F, G can be constants or given functions of x and y.
Definition 3. Parabolic equations are second-order linear PDEs which satisfy the
property B 2 − 4AC = 0. Parabolic PDEs are often used to describe heat flow and diffusion
processes.
Definition 4. The one-dimensional heat equation is a PDE in the form
ut = α · uxx ,
where u is a function of space x and time t, and α > 0 is the diffusivity coefficient.

CHAPTER 5. INTRODUCTION II

42

The heat equation is parabolic because 02 − 4α · 0 = 0, and it is capable of describing
the diffusion of particles in a system. However, the heat equation only describes linear
diffusive behaviors under conservative conditions. The introduction of source and sink
terms enables us to incorporate the non-conservative behaviors of concentrations. Notice
that the left-hand side of the heat equation is the partial derivative of the concentration
function with respect to time, in other words, the rate of change in concentration. A
positively-valued term added to the right-hand side leads to the increase in ut , and we
name such term a source. On the other hand, a negatively-valued term is named a
sink. These terms describes the non-conservative increase or decrease in concentrations
of species in the system.
In addition, to solve differential equations, we need initial conditions and boundary
conditions. The initial condition provides information about the concentration in the
system at an initial time. The boundary conditions are given to compensate for the fact
that the partial derivatives are not well-defined at the boundaries. During the diffusion
process, there should be no net flow of particles through the boundary, i.e., the spatial
derivatives at the boundaries should be zero. This type of boundary conditions is called
Neumann boundary conditions.
With an appropriate system of parabolic PDEs, initial, and boundary conditions, we
shall proceed to numerically solve the system with the method of finite differences, since
it would be too hard, if not impossible, to solve analytically.

CHAPTER 5. INTRODUCTION II

5.3

43

Method of Finite Differences

The differential equations with sink and source terms described in the previous section
are usually nonlinear, and thus too complicated to be solved analytically. We need to devise our toolbox with numerical methods to solve them. Of the many different approaches
to solving PDEs numerically, we use the method of finite differences to numerically approximate our physical reality [Tho95]. The method of finite differences converts differential
equations to difference equations, whose spatial and time domains are discrete. There
are yet other numerical methods that are more efficient and accurate, but the method
of finite differences is easier to implement in a programming language. We use Wolfram
R
Mathematica
to numerically solve the PDEs which simulate the physical problem.

To start, we consider the initial-boundary-value problem of heat flow. Let V (x, t) be
a function of temperature in terms of space x and time t on the domain x ∈ [0, 1]. Let
f (x) be a function defined on x ∈ [0, 1], and let a(t) and b(t) be functions defined on
t ∈ [0, ∞). Suppose that V (x, t) satisfies
Vt = α · Vxx , x ∈ (0, 1), t > 0

(5.12)

V (x, 0) = f (x), x ∈ [0, 1]

(5.13)

V (0, t) = a(t), V (1, t) = b(t), t ≥ 0

(5.14)

where the initial condition and the boundary conditions agree, i.e., f (0) = a(0) and
f (1) = b(0). Our first step is to convert the continuous system into a discrete expression.
We discretize the spatial domain into M + 1 equally spaced points x0 , x1 , . . . , xM −1 , xM ,

CHAPTER 5. INTRODUCTION II

44

where x0 = 0, xM = 1, and xk = k∆x for all integer-valued k that satisfies 0 ≤ k ≤ M
and ∆x = 1/M . Likewise, we discretize the time domain with spacing ∆t, and we have
points t0 , t1 , . . . on the time domain, where tn = n∆t for all integer-valued n ≥ 0. Hence,
we obtain a grid on the space-time domain as shown in Figure 5.2.

Figure 5.2: Difference Grid on the Space-Time Domain

The lattice points in the figure approximate the system (5.12)–(5.14) as ∆x → 0 and
∆t → 0, and we shall define v(k, n) to be a function defined at the point (k∆x, n∆t), in
which case v approximates V . By definition of a derivative, we know that
V (x, t + ∆t) − V (x, t)
.
∆t→0
∆t

Vt (x, t) = lim

(5.15)

Thus it is reasonable to define the derivative of the discrete function v(k, n) by

vt (k, n) =

v(k, n + 1) − v(k, n)
.

(5.16)

Likewise, the second spatial derivative of v(k, n) may be defined by the centered difference

Thus the approximated differential equation (5.12) is written as

and the initial condition and the boundary conditions are approximated by
v(k, 0) = f (k∆x)

(5.20)

v(0, n + 1) = a((n + 1)∆t)

(5.21)

v(M, n + 1) = b((n + 1)∆t)

(5.22)

The equations (5.19)–(5.22) provide an approximation for the system (5.12)–(5.14). Because we already know the initial values of v at all lattice points and the boundary values
of v at all time from equations (5.20)–(5.22), we may use equation (5.19) to iteratively
compute the value of v at each lattice point, thus giving a discrete numerical approximation for the continuous function V (x, t).

5.4

Markov Chains

A probabilistic model for the acrylate polymerization can be presented as a directional
random walk [Sza10]. A random walk is a random process consisting of a sequence of

CHAPTER 5. INTRODUCTION II

46

discrete steps. Consider a particle on the number line with initial location x = 0. In
a directional random work, there are two and only two possible options for the particle
in a time unit: there is a probability p that the particle jumps one unit to the right,
and a probability q that it stays at its current location. Additionally, the probabilities
must sum to one, i.e., p + q = 1. The states (position of the particle) and the transition
probabilities between states together form a Markov chain as shown by the state diagram
in Figure 5.3. The Markov chain satisfies the Markov assumption that the probability of
transition is only dependent on the current state and independent from all previous ones,
thus can be modeled as a Markov process.

Figure 5.3: A State Diagram of the Markov Chain for Directional Random Walk
Define P (k, t) for all k ∈ N and t ∈ N as the probability of the particle being at
position k at time t, and let pk be the transition probability for a transition from k to
k + 1 for all k ∈ N. Given an initial probability density function P (k, 0) of where the
particle might be, the probability density P (k, i + 1) at the (i + 1)-th time step can be
given by
P (k, i + 1) = P (k, i) · (1 − pk ) + P (k − 1, i) · pk−1 .

(5.23)

The first term on the right hand side stands for the probability that the particle was at

CHAPTER 5. INTRODUCTION II

47

position k at the i-th time step, and did not move in the subsequent time iteration; the
second term stands for the probability that the particle was at position k − 1 at the i-th
time step, and moved one step forward in the subsequent time iteration. Mathematical
induction allows us to iteratively approximate the probability density P (k, t) at the t-th
time step for all k ∈ N. The expected value E[K, t] of the location of the particle at time
t can be computed with
E[K, t] =

∞

k · P (k, t).

k=0

We may use this expected value as the expected position of the particle at time t.

(5.24)

Chapter 6
Memory Effect Characterization
The ultimate goal of this project is to develop a mathematical model that describes
the acrylate polymerization reaction as well as the memory effect (Section 1.4). Here we
present an experimental method to quantify the memory effect. We studied the simplest
case – two dots drawn consecutively with a hiatus time in between. Because both the
diffusive behavior and the decay of radicals depend heavily on time, we need to accurately
measure all the time periods between and during events. In addition to our usual setup, we
used an oscilloscope to measure the exposure time and hiatus time. The percent growth
in dot size is measured and tabulated for different spacing and hiatus time conditions,
and is used as a measure of the “extent” of memory effect.

Oscilloscope Setup

A digital oscilloscope (Rigor DS1204B) was connected to the shutter control to monitor
the electronic signals. The voltage output of the shutter trigger was connected to Channel
1 of the oscilloscope. The time scale was set to be 500.0 ms per grid, and the voltage
scale was set to be 20.0 V per grid (Figure 6.1a). For monitoring a double-dot exposure,
the oscilloscope run control was set to “Single”, which is triggered by a change in the
input voltage. A measurement of 0.50-second exposure time and 1.0-second hiatus time
is shown in Figure 6.1b.

Table 6.1: Base Speed Range for Specific Hiatus Time
Depending on the amount of index matched immersion oil applied between the sample
and the lens, the actual moving speed of the automated stage differs from the base speed
set by the DLW program. The base speed of the program was adjusted according to
Table 6.1 so that the hiatus time can be as close to the desired value as possible. At
the same time, a camera (Thorlabs UC480) mounted on the microscope was set to a
resolution of 480 × 240 pixels with a frame rate of 101.61 frames per second for further
high-speed analysis in the model. The laser power was set to 200 nW. When the laser,
program, oscilloscope, and camera were all prepared accordingly, a double-dot fabrication
was operated with the camera taking a high-speed video. After all the double-dots were

CHAPTER 6. MEMORY EFFECT CHARACTERIZATION

completed, the sample was washed in ethanol and dried with gentle breeze of air. It was
then sputter-coated with gold and sent for SEM imaging, where we obtain data for the
dot sizes in each double-dot fabrication.

6.3

Results

The size of each dot under each fabrication are listed in Table 6.2. Notice that some
of the hiatus times or exposure times were not controlled exactly the same as the desired
value because the machine sometimes had unpredictable electronic delays. In addition,
the last two sets (#8, #9) of measurements are not provided because the two dots merged
with each other due to the lack of space between them. Figure 6.2 shows the outcome
of measurement #9. The SEM images of all nine sets of double-dot measurement are
provided in Appendix C.

Discussion

From Table 6.2, two points can be concluded:
• if the spacing between two dots is controlled, the shorter the hiatus time, the larger
the percent increase in size;
• if the hiatus time between two dots is controlled, the shorter the distance between
them, the larger the percent increase in size.
This result is within our expectation, because the memory effect is conjectured to be
a result of excessive amount of radicals and oligomer molecules due to non-local exposure
and diffusive behaviors. The diffusion needs time to proceed, thus in a given amount of
time, the further away the second exposure is, the less influence from the first exposure
imposes on the second. The radicals also decay when two of them quench each other
(Section 1.3). The decay process also has a rate, so that the longer we wait after we
fabricate the first dot, the less influence from the first exposure imposes on the second.

Chapter 7
Modeling the Memory Effect
We first modeled the memory effect with the heat equation and approximated the
changes in the concentration of photoinitiator and radicals (including initial radicals,
acrylate monomer radicals, and acrylate oligomer radicals). The PDEs were numerically
solved with the method of finite differences, and the solutions were computed in Mathematica as functions of space and time. We then associated the transition probabilities of
a Markov chain to the radical concentration, and utilized the Markov chain to generate
a probabilistic model that describes the growth of polymer. When the model was completed, the parameters were adjusted so that the results from the model better fit the
experimental data obtained in Chapter 6.
In order to prevent confusion, a table of variables and coefficients, and a table of
functions and lists, are provided in Tables 7.1 and 7.2.

First Approximation: Radical Initiation

The first chemical change we approximate is the consumption of the photoinitiator.
The concentration of the photoinitiator is denoted c(x, t) as a function of space x and
time t. We choose a spatial domain wide enough to enclose all changes necessary for con-

CHAPTER 7. MODELING THE MEMORY EFFECT

57

sideration. In this case, we define our spatial domain with a length of 20 µm, and the first
exposure is set at x = 5 µm. As the photoresist is exposed to the laser beam, the photoinitiator gets excited and splits into two radicals, thus reducing its own concentration. We
assume that the amount of excited photoinitiator molecules is proportional to the intensity of the exposure and the concentration of photoinitiator. Because the concentrations
of species are hard, if not impossible, to determine experimentally, we assume arbitrary
units for concentrations. Let α be the diffusivity of photoinitiator in the photoresist, I(x)
be the intensity function, R(x) be the function that describes the intensity of reflections
within the photoresist, and m be the conversion coefficient of photoinitiation with respect
to beam intensity. Then the PDE that describes the concentration of photoinitiator is

It turns out, in the end, that the reflection term R(x) plays an important role in this
model of memory effect. Without this term, we were not able to obtain data for the
percent increase that was comparable to the experimental results. A plot of the reflection
term, R(x), together with the beam intensity, I(x), is given in Figure 7.1, where the blue
curve shows the beam intensity and the purple curve shows the intensity due to reflection.

Notice that we use Neumann boundary conditions for this approximation because we want
to assume zero net flow of concentrations at the boundaries. This is different from the
example given in Section 5.3, where we considered Dirichlet boundary conditions. There
are several ways to treat the Neumann boundary conditions [Tho95]. For simplicity, we

would use a one-sided difference approximation of cx (0, t) to get

or, equivalently,
c(0, n + 1) = c(1, n + 1) and c(M, n + 1) = c(M − 1, n + 1).

(7.7)

Thus, equations (7.5)–(7.7) approximate the differential equation described by equations
(7.1)–(7.3).

7.2

Second Approximation: Acrylate Initiation

With a method similar to the last section, we can also approximate the concentration
of radicals. This concentration is denoted u(x, t) as a function of space x and time t on the
same spatial domain x ∈ [0, 20]. The mechanism mentioned in Section 1.3 suggests that
one molecule of photoinitiator gets excited and splits into two radicals. Conservation of
Mass implies that the increase in radicals equals twice the consumption in photoinitiators.
At the same time, radicals are not stable and tend to quench each other when they
are placed in the same vessel. Hence, a sink term describing the decay of radicals is
also included. Radical quenching always involve two radicals, which suggests that the
quenching reaction is second-order. Thus the rate of decay, given by d, is proportional to
the second power of radical concentration. Let β be the diffusivity of radicals. Then the

PDE describing the radical concentration is

(7.9)

Notice that this PDE involves the concentration of photoinitiator c(x, t). Thus it forms a
coupled system of PDEs with equations (7.1)–(7.3). Its corresponding difference equation
is

CHAPTER 7. MODELING THE MEMORY EFFECT

61

Therefore, equations (7.5)–(7.7) and (7.12)–(7.14) form a coupled system of difference
equations that describes the concentration of photoinitiator and radicals in the photoresist. Our next step is to model the process of polymerization using Markov chains.

7.3

Probability of Polymerization

We use the concept of Markov chains introduced in Section 5.4 to model the polymerization of the photoresist, in which case we consider the particle to be the boundaries
of the polymer. It simplifies the two-dimensional polymerization by modeling along the
one-dimensional line connecting two exposure centers. A jump to the right to be polymerization over one spatial unit, and no jump as no growth in the polymer. Then the
states of this Markov chain are the possible positions for the left and right boundaries
of the polymer, and the transition probability is the probability of polymerization given
the radical concentration at the position of the boundary. We first define the transition
probability p(u), i.e., probability of polymerization, as a function of radical concentration
u.
First of all, we expect there to be a threshold on the radical concentration that governs
the polymerization reaction: higher than the threshold concentration, polymerization
is likely to occur, and vice versa. Then we consider the extremes: when the radical
concentration is close to zero, the probability of polymerization is expected to be close
to 0; when the radical concentration is very high, the probability of polymerization is

expected to be close to 1. Finally, we expect a smooth transition near the threshold
concentration. In conclusion, a probability of polymerization p(u) as a function of radical
concentration u is expected to have a plot resembling Figure 7.2a. Note that the plot of the
probability function resembles the phase paths of the differential equation y 0 = ky(1 − y),
where k is a positive constant.

where the constant k controls the “steepness” of the transition between 0 and 1, and the
ratio of c and k controls the threshold concentration for polymerization. We shall proceed
to use this probability of polymerization for Markov modeling.

7.4

Third Approximation: Markov Modeling

The Markov model is based on the difference model described in Sections 7.1 and 7.2.
We define Pl (k, n) and Pr (k, n) as the probability of the left and right boundaries, respectively, to be at the k-th spatial unit at the n-th time step, where k is an integer between
0 and M , and n is a non-negative integer. The polymerization is expected to start at the
center of exposure x = 5 µm. It follows that the initial conditions for the probability density functions of the left and right boundaries, Pl (k, n) and Pr (k, n), respectively, should
be defined by

Pl (k, 0) = Pr (k, 0) =





1, if k∆x ≤ 5 < (k + 1)∆x,

(7.17)




0, otherwise.
Because most of the cases that we experimentally tested did not yield dot size greater
than 10 µm, it is safe to assume the boundary conditions

Pl (0, n) = Pl (M, n) = 0,

and Pr (0, n) = Pr (M, n) = 0.

(7.18)

The discrete probability density functions are updated during each time iteration according to equation (5.23). Since we have derived the probability of polymerization with

CHAPTER 7. MODELING THE MEMORY EFFECT

64

respect to radical concentration, we may rewrite the equation into


Pl (k, n + 1) = Pl (k, n) · 1 − p u(k, n) + Pl (k + 1, n) · p u(k + 1, n) ,

Pr (k, n + 1) = Pr (k, n) · 1 − p u(k, n) + Pr (k − 1, n) · p u(k − 1, n) .

(7.20)

and

With equations (7.17)–(7.20), we are able to obtain the discrete probability density functions Pl (k, n) and Pr (k, n), which describe the positions of the left and right boundaries
of the polymer at any time step. With the probability density functions, the expected
values of the boundary positions can be computed by equation (5.24). We model the
second exposure in the same way, except that we need to use different initial conditions
in (7.21)–(7.23) according to the spacing between two exposures.

(7.23)

Significant changes in physical properties take place when the acrylate-based photoresist turns into polymer. The index of refraction changes when the photoresist turns from a
liquid to a solid, and thus we are able to see the polymer under the microscope. Moreover,
the diffusivity changes dramatically because it is hard for particles to flow within solid
state matters. The diffusive behaviors are therefore turned off by setting the diffusivity
coefficients α and β to zero between the boundaries of the polymer.

Chapter 8
Mathematica Implementation
In this chapter, we first develop a framework of the implementation in Mathematica
by programming the model for the system of PDEs that describes the concentrations
of photoinitiator and radicals. Then we use the framework to implement the markov
model into the program. The result of the model is compared with the experimentallydetermined data to evaluate the validity of the model.

8.1

Finite Difference Modeling

The program starts by setting up all the parameters and variables for the beam profile
and exposure. The initial conditions of c and u are set with a For loop which generates
two lists initc and initu of length M + 1 consisting of 1’s and 0’s, respectively. These
two lists are appended into c and u, respectively, as the initial time iteration.

65

CHAPTER 8. MATHEMATICA IMPLEMENTATION

66

A new For loop is used for time iterations. At the start of each time iteration, empty
lists cnew and unew are generated for storing the values of concentration during the
current time iteration. Another For loop is then used for spatial iterations, which puts
the concentration values into the lists cnew and unew. An If statement checks whether
the current spatial grid is at the boundary and, if it is, the If statement makes changes
to preserve the boundary conditions. At the end of each time iteration, the completed
lists cnew and unew are appended to lists c and u, respectively.
When all the time iterations are completed, a Manipulate command, together with a
ListLinePlot, is used to show the change in the concentration of species during the time
period which the program simulated.

8.2

Markov Modeling

The implementation of Markov modeling inherits the framework set up in the previous
section. In addition to the initial conditions for c and u, we also need to include the initial
conditions for pLeft and pRight. Moreover, we introduce another list Poly to keep track
of the polymerized spatial units so that we are able to turn off diffusive behaviors in
these units. The content of this list is essentially only 0’s and 1’s, where a 0 means not
polymerized and 1 polymerized for the corresponding spatial grid.
In the For loop for time iteration, two new lists pnewLeft and pnewRight are constructed in the same fashion as we construct c and u, and appended to pLeft and pRight,

CHAPTER 8. MATHEMATICA IMPLEMENTATION

67

respectively, at the end of each time iteration. The expected values of left and right
boundaries are calculated after pnewLeft and pnewRight are generated, and an update of
newPoly, which has 1’s between the expected boundaries and 0’s elsewhere, is appended
to Poly. For the second exposure, the initial conditions for c, u, and Poly are the same
as their final states during the simulation for the first exposure, but the initial conditions
for pLeft and pRight have to be reset to the new exposure center because we cannot
have four boundaries for a growing polymer.
The Manipulate command is modified so that the expected boundaries of the polymer
dots are visible in the simulation. In addition, the number of polymerized spatial units
are printed as the output at the end of the simulation for each exposure. The percent
increase is also calculated at the very end of the program.
Pseudocodes for the complete implementation is provided in the next section. Additionally, a completed version of the program in Wolfram Mathematicar 8 is provided in
Appendix D. The code is fragmented into functional modules and arranged as sections of
the appendix. The indices of lists in the code are off by 1 because we started our indices
at 0 but Mathematica takes 1 as the index of the first item of a list structure.

Pseudocode for the Implementation

The pseudocode for modeling the polymerization under a double exposure is included
in the next page to demonstrate the flow of the program.

Results and Discussion

The parameters of the model were adjusted to fit the experimental data provided in
Table 6.2. Table 8.1 shows the chosen values of all the adjustable parameters and functions
used in the final version of the model. The first dot of each experiment has 0.5-second
exposure, and we assume the second exposure does not affect the size of the first dot.

Then we compute the average size of the first dot to be 2.1 ± 0.3 µm. This size was
measured under SEM, thus after shrinkage. If we account for the shrinkage coefficient of
photoresist #3 (25%, Table 3.2), the average dot size before shrinkage would be 2.8 ± 0.4
µm. After painstaking efforts on adjusting the parameters, we achieved 2.76 µm for the
size of the first dot computed by the model. The dot sizes simulated by the model are
provided in Table 8.2. The simulation of experiment #2 is provided in Figure 8.1 by one

indicate the size of the growing polymer. A more detailed simulation of this experiment
is provided in Appendix E with one screeshot every 0.1 second.
The percent increase values simulated by the model and the experimentally-determined
values are tabulated in Table 8.3. Both sets of data showed the same pattern. The
memory effect is stronger at places close to the exposed areas, and is reduced far away
from fabricated structures. The memory effect is also stronger immediately after one
exposure, and if we wait a while after an exposure, memory effect can be reduced.

CHAPTER 8. MATHEMATICA IMPLEMENTATION

73

We notice that the experimental data #8 showed two dots merged together due to
their proximity (Figure C.8), yet the model still suggested two distinct dots. But if we
take a closer look at the final state of the model (Figure 8.2), the distance between two
boundaries is only 1 spatial unit, which converts to 50 nm. This distance is so small that
we can consider the dots as merged together.

8.5

Future Development

First of all, we can tune the parameters and adjustable function in the model more
carefully and more finely to make the outputs of the model closer to the experimental
values. We may also test the model for double-dot experiments with different laser power
and/or different exposure time.
We have successfully used a radical scavenger ingredient for the photoresist to reduce
the linewidth as well as the memory effect. We have also developed a model describing
the polymerization reaction with double dots. The natural step to follow would be modeling memory effect in the photoresist without the radical scavenger. By comparing the
differences in these two models, we may be able to suggest the role of radical scavenger
in reducing linewidth and memory effect.
Another possible direction to go would be taking the model into higher dimensions.
Currently the model describes the polymerization reaction along the line connecting two
exposures, which has only one spatial dimension. It is possible that we can develop a two-

CHAPTER 8. MATHEMATICA IMPLEMENTATION

74

dimensional model which tells the polymerization on a plane. Given specific fabrication
conditions, the two-dimensional model may be able to simulate the outcome of a DLW
experiment before actually running the experiment.

Appendix F
General Solutions to y 0 = ky(1 − y)
We first rewrite the differential equation into
dy
− ky = −ky 2 .

dy
= −u−2 .

(F.2)

dx

(F.3)

Let u = y −1 , then y = u−1 , thus

By Chain Rule, it follows that

Substitute (F.3) into (F.1), we obtain
−u−2 ·

du
− ku−1 = −ku−2 .
dx

(F.4)

Multiply both sides by −u2 , we obtain
du
+ ku = k.

Let the integrating factor µ(x) = e

factor, then integrate over x, we get

(F.6)

The integrand of the left-hand side is the derivative of ekx · u(x), and the integrand of the
right-hand side is the derivative of ekx . Thus we have
ekx · u(x) = ekx + C.

(F.7)

u(x) = 1 + ec−kx .

(F.8)

We solve for u(x), and get

Thus the general solution to y(x), in closed form, is

y(x) =
