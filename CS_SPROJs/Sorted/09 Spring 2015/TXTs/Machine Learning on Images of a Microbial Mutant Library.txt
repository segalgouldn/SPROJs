Abstract

Environmental isolates, like BJB312, are interesting because of their potential therapeutic properties. Transposon mutagenesis is a technique used to determine the function of
genes by randomly disrupting a genome and observing the phenotypic effects. The genome
of BJB312 consists of over 5,000 genes, requiring 57,000 independent insertion mutants in
order to break every gene in the genome. It is unwieldy to screen such a large library for
defects. I used image processing techniques to convert qualitative data of mutant bacterial
colonies morphology into a quantitative data set that is susceptible to data mining. Further, I built a tool of ensemble machine learning techniques that automatically analyze
a large library of mutants. It first uses the unsupervised methods k-means and Wards
hierarchical clustering to find a patterned, recurrent phenotype. It then uses a Support
Vector Machine to screen the library at large. This tool is robust and useful on real-world
data because it utilizes Machine Learning techniques to filter the image library before
reaching the final clustering solution. Ten transposon insertion mutants that clustered
together were characterized by lessened biofilm. This proof-of-concept study shows that
genomic and high-throughput functional characterizations can be combined in order to
rapidly explore a novel microbe.

Introduction

Large mutant libraries are powerful tools for characterizing a novel strain of bacteria.
Libraries can be screened for phenotypes and the genes associated with that trait can be
determined. Libraries are generally made as large as possible in order to increase the
chances of disrupting more genes and gaining a fuller annotation of the genome. However,
as libraries increase in size it becomes unwieldy to screen them in fully functional assays.
Consequently, mutant libraries are made but typically only a couple of the mutant strains
are examined for their phenotype and so function is only assigned to a few genes at a time
based on the abnormal trait displayed.
I have made a tool that allows for the comprehensive exploration of a mutant library
and a functional assessment of its genome by automating functional assay screening (Figure 1.0.1). Image processing techniques allow qualitative data of microbial phenotypes to
be translated into a large quantitative data set. This transformation is crucial because it
makes the library susceptible to data mining. Machine Learning techniques such as clustering and support vector machines can analyze the large, heterogeneous data set and find
patterns that would not be practical to find by hand.

1. INTRODUCTION

This tool does not require any knowledge of the mutant library. It uses unsupervised
machine learning to find recurrent patterns of phenotypes. Subsequently, a phenotype of
interest can be explored to saturation using supervised SVM classification; once a phenotype group has been identified, all close or related phenotype mutants can be collected
from the mutant library and all relevant genes can be identified. The ensemble of these
unsupervised and supervised machine learning methods creates a complete workflow that
can discover new phenotypes and generate training data and then use that training data
to characterize the entire library with respect to a phenotype of interest.

Figure 1.0.1. (A) The standard workflow for exploring a library of mutants needs to be
repeated in order to identify all genes that contribute to a phenotype. (B) The method developed in this study could potentially explore a phenotype to saturation in one iteration.

This tool is robust because it uses Machine Learning to filter the data set before
performing clustering and classification. Practically speaking, large, manually-plated mutant libraries will have some errant elements. Image processing tools first address this by
only capturing mutants that can be identified using a Hough Circle Transform. Secondly,

1. INTRODUCTION

k-means sequesters repeating artifacts. Thirdly, a one-class SVM refines the data set so
that it only includes mutants that appear morphologically different from the wild type.
These filtering methods improve the statistical measures and biologically usefulness of
clustering solutions.
In this study, I characterized a library of ∼ 4,000 BJB312 mutants and found a
group of biofilm-deficient mutants. This study does not fully characterize BJB312 or its
biofilm characteristics, but these scale vertically and horizontally; they could be applied to
a larger library in order to reach saturation of a phenotype; they could be used to analyze
a library repeatedly form different perspectives, investigating a variety of phenotypes.

Background in Biology

2.1 Culturing Microbes in the Laboratory.
The mechanisms of microbes can be untangled when the microbes are cultured in a
laboratory. In a controlled laboratory setting, microbial strains are cultured and subjected
to genetic, molecular, biochemical and physiological tests so that their characteristics can
be better known. Isolated environmental strains of bacteria can be studied in controlled
conditions to reveal their individual functionalities. Isolating bacteria allows for the study
of these characteristics. Many environmental strains have effects on human health and
the ecosystem, and environmental microbiological surveys allow for the determination
of potential health and environmental risks [Guo et al., 2015, Landell et al., 2013]. It is
important to study bacterial strains that cause disease such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa,
Escherichia coli and Staphylococcus aureus in order to develop effective treatments [Ruiz
et al., 2004, Kosmidis et al., 2012, Titilawo et al., 2015] . By looking closely at clinical
and environmental isolates, we can begin to understand these bacterias strengths and
weaknesses in order to combat disease, propel industries, and study environments.

2. BACKGROUND IN BIOLOGY

13

Determining how microbes resist antibiotics or infect humans allows for the development of technologies that combat these things. Culture assays are the primary ways to
determine how microbes work, which are important because of the ubiquitous direct and
indirect interactions we have with microbes in our shared environment.

2.2 The Hudson Valley Watershed
Bacterial environmental isolates can provide information about the ecosystem, and
have the potential to be used as therapeutics. Water samples from different fresh water
bodies throughout the Hudson Valley Watershed can provide samples of the environmental
bacteria present (Figure 2.2.1). By isolating bacteria from different areas of the Hudson
Valley Watershed and culturing them to figure out their traits, they can be compared.
Surveys of environmental isolates can reveal new bacteria that have unique and useful
attributes.
Various violacein-producing bacteria have been isolated from fresh water samples of
the Hudson Valley Watershed (Figure 2.2.2). Some of these strains have been identified as
Janthinobacterium. Janthinobacterium are Gram-negative bacteria found in aqueous and
soil environments. They grow at room temperature, but the full range of temperatures
they can live in is not specifically defined. They characteristically display antibiotic resistance form biofilms and produce metabolites such as hydrogen [Ning et al., 2012, Pidot
et al., 2013, Xia et al., 2014]. In particular, a species of Janthinobacterium that is known
to produce violacein is Janthinobacterium lividum. Violacein producers are important to
study in the laboratory because they have potential therapeutic properties.

2.3 Violacein
Violacein is a purple pigment indole derivative of tryptophan [Duran et al., 2007]. It
is produced by some well-studied microbes such as Chromobacterium violacein and Jan-

shades of purple (arrows).

thinobacterium lividum as well as a plethora of unstudied environmental isolates [Duran
and Menck, 2001, Pantanella et al., 2006, Hoshino, 2011]. There is a breadth of therapeutic properties associated with this purple compound. There are indications that it is
protective for many reasons. For example, studies suggest it is anti-parasitic, anti-viral,
and anti-fungal [Lopes et al., 2009, Andrighetti-Frohner et al., 2003, Andrighetti-Fröhner
et al., 2006]. It has even been considered for its activity against cancers, including human leukemia [Kodach et al., 2006, Ferreira, 2004]. In corroboration with the utility of
violacein, studies have shown that violacein is produced in response to stress. Physical
agitation of bacterial colonies caused aggregation and violacein production [Yang et al.,
2007]. Given these properties, it is evident that producing violacein during times of duress
is advantageous.

Hudson Valley fresh water samples on (A-E) LB and (C) on R2A). (F-J) Gram stains of
each strain show colony morphology and indicate Gram negative bacteria. Scale bar =
5.58µm.

What is known about violacein comes from studies of well-known strains in the laboratory and can inform the exploration of new isolates. The operon responsible for violacein production, the vio operon, was discovered through studying Ch. violaceum [August
et al., 2000]. The vio operon consists of five genes: vioA, vioB, vioC, vioD, vioE (Figure 2.3.1). The genes textitvioA-vioE work together to convert tryptophan into violacein
Duran:2007de. Other bacteria, such a J. lividum, have since been shown to contain a
homologous operon in their genome.
Beyond violacein production, the effectiveness of violacein and extent to which the
properties of the pure chemical are practically advantageous depend on the program of

2. BACKGROUND IN BIOLOGY

16

violacein production, violacein release, and ultimately survival of the violacein-producers.
These, in turn, depend on biofilm.

2.4 Biofilm
Biofilms are organized communities of microbes encapsulated in extracellular polymeric substances growing in functional structures, containing nucleic acids proteins, minerals, nutrients and cell wall material to promote bacterial growth, and increasing their
fitness and survival [Costerton et al., 1987, Carpentier and Cerf, 1993]. The stability of
the bacteria allow for architectures to be built and maintained. The survival of many microbes, especially those in aqueous environments, often depends on the robustness of their

2. BACKGROUND IN BIOLOGY

17

biofilm; taller, more differentiated, more rugose biofilms are often associated with large
aggregates of cells whereas smooth, while short and uniform biofilms are more susceptible
to detergents like sodium dodecyl sulfate [Davies et al., 1998]. This example illustrates the
importance of biofilm and how it promotes microbial communities that are very different
than motile, suspended ones.
Although the bacterial cells are covered in extracellular material, the architecture
of biofilms is highly porous and, as many biofilms are located in aqueous environments,
is open to a constant flow of water [Lawrence et al., 1989]. Acting as a filter, the physical structure of biofilms is thus advantageous because it protects cells from threats of
the external environment such as predation or antibiotics, while selectively allowing open
exchange with desired parts of the environment, such as nutrients, from the water [Carpentier and Cerf, 1993, Coquet et al., , Mah and O’Toole, 2001]. For example, a type of
architecture that roughly resembles a mushroom architecture provides these intricate services. Two common architectural elements seen in P. aeruginosa biofilms are stalks and
caps that together form mushroom-like structures; stalk cells are attached to the surface
are form the base of the biofilm and hold up cap cells, which project further into the environment [Pamp et al., 2008]. Bacterial stalk cells are morphologically distinct from the cap
cells, have lower metabolisms and are non-motile. On the other hand, cap cells have higher
metabolisms, and are more like aggregates of motile bacteria [Pamp et al., 2008,Alavi and
Belas, 2001].This pattern can be advantageous, allowing nutrients to diffuse more easily
into the peripheral parts of the biofilm. The structural differences in the stalk and cap
bacteria are demonstrated by the differential effects the antibiotics tetracycline and colistin have on cap and stalk bacteria respectively [Haagensen et al., 2006, Bjarnsholt et al.,
2005].
Biofilms are protective and have been observed to form when bacteria are in adverse situations, such as under the stress of starvation, antibiotics and foreign immune

2. BACKGROUND IN BIOLOGY

18

responses [Landry et al., 2006]. Biofilms show more resistance to antibiotics, antibodies,
surfactants, bacteriophages and predators like amoeba than planktonic bacteria [Hentzer
et al., 2001]. For example, to increase its tolerance to the antibiotic tobramycin biofilm
becomes mucoid by overproducing alginate [Stapper, 2004, Hentzer et al., 2001]. Because
biofilms are associated with relatively stable population sizes, low growth, they are able
to avoid the activity of many bacteriostatic antibiotics [Eng et al., 1991]. The thickness
of biofilms affects the metabolic rate of bacteria in the community, thus affecting the rate
at which cells require nutrients and take in exogenous molecules; when cells require fewer
nutrients, having an antibiotic deprive them of nutrients has less of an impact [Whitford
and Schumacher, 1964].
Biofilm formation is a highly organized process. Both the temporal and spatial regulation of biofilm are important; when microbes identify a favorable environment, they grow
in abundance until they are able to expend energy on functions other than rapid replication, setting up permanent shop. Biofilms begin to be seen in their stationary phase and
are maximal in the early death stages. Biofilm formation also depends on their surrounding, on whether a favorable carbon source, such as glycerol, is present and on whether it is
faced with stressors such as ampicillin [Pantanella et al., 2006]. Biofilms are also affected
by factors such as pH, oxygen levels, carbon sources, osmolarity, and friction levels during growth (affecting attachment and thickness) [O’Toole et al., 2000, Biggs and hickey,
1994, Graba et al., 2013].
Biofilm begins with primary adhesion, or stochastic events of contact between planktonic organisms and a conditioned surface [Marshall et al., 1971]. This form of attachment
is reversible and allows bacteria to sample surfaces while determining a good location for
adhesion. Beyond observing a potential surface, bacteria condition surfaces to make conditions more favorable for interactions, for example, by producing biosurfactants such as
rhamnolipids [Tremblay et al., 2007,Gristina, 1987]. While making primary adhesions and

2. BACKGROUND IN BIOLOGY

19

with the encouragement of biosurfactants, bacterial cells can perform a different, surface
based motility called swarming and form a monolayer, migrating around the surface before
aggregating [O’Toole and Kolter, 1998]. For example P. aeruginosa has been reported to
use twitching motility and chemotaxis to move up gradients of phospholipids, suggesting
like activities could be employed when exploring new surfaces [Kearns et al., 2001]. After
a suitable surface has been sampled, bacterial cells make a permanent attachments to
the surface. In this process, adhesion proteins make molecular and specific binds with a
conditioned surface, anchoring the bacteria to the surface. The complexity of biofilm formation illustrates the breadth of genes that play a role in biofilm regulation; biofilm is an
exemplary polygenic complex trait. This, it is important to study it using high-throughput
genetic studies.
There are a number of genes identified as important genes in biofilm formation
in J anthinobacterium species, including pel and psl, which code for exopolysaccharides
involved in attachment and encasing [Friedman and Kolter, 2004, Jackson et al., 2004,
Matsukawa and Greenberg, 2004]. In addition, the r hlI and r hlR pathways are important
because rhamnolipids are crucial for maintaining the pores in biofilms by disruption cellcell and cell-substrate connections and encouraging swarming [Davey et al., 2003]. This
pathway is controlled by QS, specifically c-di-GMP binds to pelD and increases EPS
production [Lee et al., 2007]. This concurs with data suggesting a link between QS and
biofilm production [Davies et al., 1998]. Adhesions are transcriptionally regulated and can
be turned on depending on the environment [Ziebuhr et al., 1999].

2.5 Chytridiomycosis
The survival, violacein production and biofilm formation of violacein producers,
like J anthinobacterium, are important because of the ecological role they play, defending
amphibians from the fungal pathogen Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (B d) (Figure 2.5.1).

2. BACKGROUND IN BIOLOGY

microscopy,scale bar = 25µm, and (B) bright field microscopy, scale bar = 10.05µm.

Bd is a fungal pathogen that causes a lethal skin disease called chytridiomycosis
(chytrid) in amphibian populations worldwide (Figure 2.5.2). As of 2014, 32.5% of all
amphibian species were threatened by Bd [Longcore et al., 2014]. Some symptoms of
chytrid are tissue erosion, hyperkeratosis, hyperplasia, weight loss, and death [Berger et al.,
]. Chytrid may have been responsible for declines in amphibian population since the 1970s,
and is becoming more prolific [Corn and Fogleman, 1984, Carey, 1993].
As with the decline of any species, the devastation of amphibians means more than
just the loss of amphibian populations. Loss of any population corresponds to a loss of
local diversity, which has many ramifications [Ouellet et al., 2005, ?]. The food web in
which the amphibians participate loses balance as the resources they consumed become

overabundant and those they produced become scarce. Diversity loss is associated with the
increased spread of disease effecting members across a community [Keesing et al., 2010].
Humans are part of the ecological systems in which diseases are spreading more easily, and
it behooves us to understand the mechanisms to counter B d. B d is the only chytrid within
the rhizophydiales clade to infect vertebrates [Joneson et al., 2011]. On vertebrates, B d
lives on skin and strictly infects keratinocytes [Symonds et al., 2008]. Although amphibians
are known to excrete anti-microbial peptides onto their skin as an immune response, this
mechanism doesnt appear to be acting to counter B d [Rollins-Smith et al., 2002, Pessier
et al., 1999]. Perhaps the pathogen is successful because, being a chytrid, it is unlike other

2. BACKGROUND IN BIOLOGY

22

amphibian pathogens and does not trigger the release of defense peptides, circumventing
the system that protects frogs from other pathogens.

2.6 Bioaugmentation and J anthinobacterium
Amphibian populations are not able to defend themselves from B d, but some have
potentially partnered up with protective microbes. Studies have reported mutualism between cutaneous bacteria and amphibian hosts such as the eastern red-backed salamander,
female four-toes salamanders and mountain yellow-legged frogs, Rana muscosa [Harris
et al., 2009, Lauer et al., 2007a, Woodhams et al., 2011]. Further surveys have observed
that amphibian populations that sustainably coexists with B d have higher levels of protective bacteria than similar amphibian populations that are experiencing rapid Bd induced
decline [Woodhams et al., 2007, Lam et al., 2010]. This suggests that bacteria act to subdue B d, allowing the cohabitation of B d and amphibians without as rapid death. Some
of these bacteria are violacein-producers (Figure 2.6.1).
Protective bacteria can fight off pathogens by producing anti-fungal, anti-microbial,
or otherwise therapeutic metabolites. Violacein has been shown to repel and inhibit B d
growth in the laboratory (data not shown). This is not surprising given the reported properties of violacein: antibacterial, antiviral and anti-tumoral among others [Lopes et al.,
2009,Andrighetti-Frohner et al., 2003,Becker and Harris, 2010,Brucker et al., 2008]. Field
studies have shown that, when comparing amphibians that both have microbes including
J. lividum, those with higher amounts of violacein on their skin survive better [Brucker
et al., 2008]. The chemical nature of violacein is interesting, given its therapeutic properties. The pathway from tryptophan to violacein shares similarities with the anabolism
of antimicrobials such as the DNA binding inhibitor rebeccamycin and the protein kinase
inhibitor staurospirine [Moreau et al., 1999, Tamaoki et al., 1986]. Given these properties, it is not surprising that friendly bacteria have been shown to repel Bd, reducing

2. BACKGROUND IN BIOLOGY

23

the need for an immune response in amphibians [Lam et al., 2011](Lam, Walton, and
Harris). Additionally, protective bacteria help their host by enhancing the hosts innate
immune system [Lauer et al., 2007a, Meyer et al., 2012]. This type of defense against Bd
is highly favorable because it helps amphibians protect themselves instead of attempting
to artificially remove the threat.
Conservation methods have explored different methods of fighting chytrid. B d
zoospores are sensitive to fungicides and extreme heat [Johnson and Speare, 2003]. However, many treatments such as these, that are successful in a laboratory, are not realistically applicable to natural ecosystems. Conservation efforts must recognize natural
dynamics between species in order to be effective. Well-deigned bioaugmentation recognizes relationships between organisms in an environment and capitalizes on pre-existing
mutualism. Specifically, bioaugmentation efforts could (and have began to) harness the

2. BACKGROUND IN BIOLOGY

24

power of violacein-producing cutaneous bacteria that live on amphibians to protect their
hosts from B d.
Bioaugmentation, when designed well, is a superior conservation method because it
can work with the normal flora and fauna and be self-propelling. Firstly, probiotics can
reproduce and sustain themselves as a population Bletz:2013ka. Because bacteria often use
metabolites to fend off pathogens, it stands to reason that the species of bacteria is not
as important for effective protection as much as genes that code for a specific metabolite.
Considering that the v io operon is near a movable element in genomes such as J. lividum,
it is possible that genetic transfer can help proliferate protective bacteria beyond just
the colonization of a single species. Protective qualities can transfer through a microbial
community vertically, horizontally or environmentally. These methods may be advantageous because they provide the opportunity for protective bacteria to become prevalent
enough to be effective without a microbiome turning into a monoculture; a diverse range
of organisms can be protective. This will help heed the principle of disrupting natural
balance as little as possible and thus avoiding the adverse effects such as increase disease
spread that accompany loss of diversity [Belden and Harris, 2007]. Preliminary laboratory
experiments have demonstrated that bacteria, such as J. lividum, have reduced the effects
of B d [Lauer et al., 2007b]. Although these reports bode well for using bioaugmentation
in the field there remain many unaccounted variables. Efforts have tried species-specific
baths [Harris et al., 2009]. Further, community-based treatments in water or soil inoculation have been used to protect salamanders with J lividum [Muletz et al., 2012]. When
implementing bioaugmentation, careful consideration must be taken when deciding which
probiotic to introduce to an environment. Universally, a good probiotic should be a good
competitor on ventral surfaces, limbs and feet in order to co-habitate with B d [North
and Alford, 2008]. Further, it should make metabolites, like violacein, at low density or
grow to high density quickly. A similar consideration is that it should proficiently produce

2. BACKGROUND IN BIOLOGY

25

violacein because violacein is only effective past certain concentration thresholds [Becker
et al., 2009]. Biofilm formation is an important factor because it plays a role in adhering to
amphibian skin and survival and is associated with violacein production and dispersal. Different probiotics will be better for different environments depending on their metabolism;
I odobacter are anaerobic and J. lividum is aerobic, and I odobacter and Ch. violaceum
grow at different temperatures. The least disruptive bioaugmentation agent would be the
one native to a given amphibian population.

2.7 Environmental Isolates
Ultimately, it is crucial to explore environmental violacein-producers like BJB312
while deciding which bacterial species could be used in different populations in order to
best respect natural dynamics, avoid side-effects, and provide the most effective treatment.
Many different bacteria produce violacein including M assilia, J. lividum, Dunganella and
C ollimonas [Yada et al., 2008, Agematu et al., 2011, Aranda et al., 2011, Hakvåg et al.,
2009]. The breadth of violacein producers illustrates the potential of bioaugmentation
techniques but also calls for closer characterization of each microbe in order to use them
appropriately and with the highest yield. These violacein producers have been found in
soils and sea-waters across the world in diverse countries such as Japan, China, Spain
and Norway. In order to design effective treatments, first we need to know how violaceinproducers work. By culturing violacein producers and exploring their genome to study
violacein production properties and biofilm formation we can better apply bioaugmentation to treat B d.

2.8 Genomics
Genome data for environmental isolates is more readily available because of advances in next generation sequencing technology. Sequences for entire bacterial genomes

2. BACKGROUND IN BIOLOGY

26

are affordable and provide a wealth of information. Software such as BLAST (Basic Local
Alignment Search Tool) and Geneious make comparative genomics simple across national
databases like PubMed and novel, in-lab studies.
Illumina sequencing is a next generation sequencing technique that allows for the
rapid sequencing of entire microbial genomes by using parallel pyrosequencing. Sequence
reads can be assembled together based on overlapping regions with tools such as Geneious,
NextGene or MIRA. These assembly tools use de Brujin graph theory to efficiently search
and match variable length sequences. The appropriate parameters such as k-mer length,
can be determined using the Velvet Optimizer. Once the whole genome is assembled, annotation tools, like RAST (Rapid Annotation using Subsystem Technology), can match
regions of the genome with known genes. By comparing genetic sequences, the nearest
neighbors of an isolate can be identified and can potentially be placed in an operational
taxonomic unit. Furthermore, knowing the sequence of an organism allows for targeted mutagenesis and in-frame gene deletion. Before such experiments can be truly useful, the isolate should be explored functionally. Having an isolates genome aids in initial un-targeted
exploration, as annotated genes are categorized into subsystems such as metabolism, resistance, and secretion systems. Thus, the genetic composition of an organism can suggest
traits and inform functional assay design.

2.9 Functional Assays
In order to compliment genomic data and learn about the functional traits of new
strains of bacteria, novel environmental isolates can be subjected to transposon mutagenesis. Transposon mutagenesis is a technique that can be used in conjunction with culturable
assays. If a strain of bacteria is culturable in the laboratory, it can be genetically manipulated to reveal the functions of its genes. Unlike gene deletion, this is a useful technique
because an organism can be studied from the point of view of a phenotype of interest, such

2. BACKGROUND IN BIOLOGY

27

as biofilm, before the genes responsible for the phenotype can be identified, allowing for
the identification of novels phenotypes and mechanisms. For example I study profile bacteria based on their biofilm morphology, which is not a trait that could be identified by a
operon in a genome [Queiroz et al., 2012]. In transposon insertion mutagenesis, the genome
of an organism is perturbed by the incorporation of an exogenous fragment of DNA. The
function of the broken gene can be inferred by the resulting loss-of-function phenotype.
Insertion mutagenesis can be site-directed, in which case it reveals the phenotype of a
specific gene of interest, or it can be random and allow for the genetic cause of an observed phenotype to be discovered. Both methods rely on the logic of using loss-of-function
phenotype to infer gene function.
Random transposon mutagenesis allows for the undirected exploration of a genome.
In random mutagenesis, the transposon is designed to invade the hosts genome at an unspecified loci, allowing any gene to be disrupted. This technique allows for the discovery
of novel mechanisms because it allows for the disruption of genes that werent previously
known to exist. It is important to be able to uncover these mechanisms; being able to
understand a pathogenic bacteria would allow us to identify and design a potential treatment [Autret and Charbit, 2005]. Most transposon mutagenesis techniques are limited to
the recovery of insertions in only non-essential genes because they rely on the growth of
the mutant for isolation. However, some methods, like TnAraOut, have found ways to
recover insertions in essential genes [Judson and Mekalanos, 2000].
Transposon mutagenesis has been used to identify many important genetic pathways.
For example, the v irB operon which is responsible for virulence factors and lipopolysaccharides in the Gram-negative human pathogen Brucella suis was identified with transposon
mutagenesis [Foulongne et al., 2000]. Genes involved in colonization by Vibrio cholera have
also been identified using transposons [Chiang and Mekalanos, 1998]. Transposon mutagenesis has been performed in many microbes including P. aeruginosa, Methanosarcina

2. BACKGROUND IN BIOLOGY

28

acetiverans, Mycobacterium tuberculosis and M ycoplasma [Pelicic et al., 1997, Hutchison III, 1999]. Because it has been successfully performed in a wide range of organisms, it
is a good candidate tool to use on environmental isolates and other previously unexplored
strains.
To accompany the breadth of studies that use transposon mutagenesis, there are
may different designed for transposon vectors. One such plasmid, built by Rachel Larson
called pRL27, contains five critical pieces in a Tn5 backbone: an origin of transfer (oriT),
a pi-dependent origin of replication (oriR), kanamycin resistance, and two primers (Figure 2.9.1). Although these five elements are essential, there is variation in the versions of
plasmids; different plasmid designs use different marker and selection elements such as a
l acZ gene or tetracycline resistance [Metcalf et al., 1996,Larsen et al., 2002,de Lorenzo and
Timmis, 1994]. In transposon insertion mutagenesis it is often preferred to use a suicide
vector, like that in the Tn5 transposon, which cannot replicate independently in their host
and thus can only be incorporated into a hosts genome once.
Because it controls for a single insertion even, pRL27 is a good candidate plasmid for
building a single insertion transposon mutant library that contains mutants with disruptions of every gene in the genome. Such a highly saturated library contains a comprehensive
set functional data and can be paired with genomic sequencing to map the functions of
every gene in the genome. Because this type of mutagenesis is random, it cannot be used
to systematically target each gene in a genome. However, probability theory can be used
to estimate the number of mutants a library must contain in order for it to likely contain
a disruption of every gene in a genome. When disruption in every gene is achieved, and
a genome has been saturated, the resulting library contains enough information to build
a comprehensive functional profile. It is not straightforward to accurately estimate the
number of mutants required to build a saturation library for any given genome. Some of
the factors include overall base-pair length of the genome, the number of genes, the bp

lengths of genes, the number of vital genes, and the bias of hotspots [Lefevre and Watkins,
1986]. Many studies determine their library size empirically, by conducting increasingly
large scale mutagenesis followed by large scale sequencing in order to determine the number of novel mutants and when that number cease to increase [Phogot et al., 2001, Jacobs
et al., 2011] (PHOGAT et al.; Jacobs et al.). This number depends so heavily on the
bacteria strain of focus and the method of mutagenesis. However, since not all studies
have the resources to empirically determine an appropriate library size, many rely on estimates. Statistical models that include many of these variables have been used to predict
saturation levels, but there is always a degree of estimation to a model as well as degrees
of uncertainty inherent in unknowns for which the model cannot account. The Poisson
distribution has provided a foundational formula for estimations of acceptable sizes for
saturation libraries PHOGAT:2001wc.In addition, the Gamma distribution is a candidate

2. BACKGROUND IN BIOLOGY

30

for such a model because it can account for the variable mutation rates across different
genes (Figure 2.9.2) [Pollock and Larkin, 2004]. There is not yet a standard model amongst
these candidates.

2.10 High Throughput Functional Assays
If the sequence of an isolates genome is available, inferences can be made about the
isolate’s phenotypic properties, such as metabolic bi-products, antibiotic resistance and
carbon utilizations can be made by comparing the sequences of an environmental isolate to
sequences of standard strains and well-studied genomes. However, inferences must be supported by experimental data when studying a trait in depth. Further, the function of novel

2. BACKGROUND IN BIOLOGY

31

genes cannot be assumed from comparable genomes, it must be discovered experimentally.
In order to keep up with the pace of information technology and the accumulation of genomic data laboratory protocols, like transposon mutagenesis, high-throughput demands
must be accommodated. The practicality of a high-throughput mutagenesis depends on
the genome and transposon, but thousands of mutants can often be produced in a day
or two. However, it is not as easy to collect and screen such large libraries. Collection
protocols and assays need to be adjusted to isolate and collect phenotypic information
from mutants quickly. This is the essential challenging in trying to gather functional data
at the same pace as genetic data can be acquired.
When high-throughput functional analyses are able to produce enough mutants,
genomes can be understood at a rate that keeps up with genomic analysis. Genomes diverse
as E. coli, P. aeruginosa, Burrelia burgdophia, Beauveria bassiana fungus Drosophila and
M aize have been explored in this way [Tong et al., 2004, Lefevre and Watkins, 1986,
Walbot, 2000, Fan et al., 2011, Jacobs et al., 2011, Stewart et al., 2004]. These researchers
aimed for saturation; they tried to break every gene in the genome at least once by
processing enough mutants that success was statistically likely. When a mutant library
contains a mutant with a gene disruption even for every gene in a genome, that genome
has become saturated. As long as functional data from these mutants is collected and
analyzed, saturation mutagenesis gives a comprehensive profile a whole the genome.

Background in Computer Science

3.1 Image Processing
There is a wealth of image data available from sources such as the internet, and images are relatively easy to capture. Sites like Facebook and Instagram have made taking
and sharing images comparably as common as sharing textual information. Digital cameras, technologies attached to microscopes, and even cell phones make gathering image
data trivial. In particular, they have allowed for the gathering of visual information from
high throughput, genetic, microbial functional studies.
The field of computer vision, or image processing, aims to extract meaningful information from digital images. The digital image is generally represented by a matrix of
1 to 4 channels: grayscale, red-green-blue or hue-saturation-value with an optional alpha
channel. Typically, the range of the channel values is 0-255 where low values are dark and
high values are bright. The enormous availability of image data has made the fields of
computer vision and image processing popular. There are many techniques and tools that
can be used to process images and extract information about their composition and/or
content from their raw pixel values (without meta data).

3. BACKGROUND IN COMPUTER SCIENCE

Pre-processing
Images are often pre-processed so they are optimally susceptible to image processing

techniques. There are some standard processing techniques that can reduce the noise of
an image and make the salient features easier to detect. One way to do this is using linear
filters to transform one image into another, thereby capturing or calculating a certain
quality of the image. Two common types of linear transformation are correlation and
convolution. Both are functions, of an N xN mask, F , and an image, I (Eq. 3.1.1 and Eq.
3.1.2).

In both of these procedures, a smaller ’mask’ image is run across a larger image,
reassigning the image’s pixel value to the sum or average of the image’s pixels multiplied
by its corresponding mask pixels. Both processes require edge case specifications because
the pixels that are near an edge cannot be computed in the standard way. Edge cases can
be handled in any manner of ways for example by using half the kernel, copying the most
adjacent pixel values, leaving the edges unchanged or padding the image with zeros so
that the edge cases use a black border. Which technique that is best depends on the level
of accuracy needed in the resulting image and the importance of the edges.
Because each pixel of the resulting image depends on the values of pixels that are in
front of and behind it, these processes cannot be done in place. Further, these processes
have time complexity proportional to the number of pixels in an image. However, the
complexity of the procedures can be reduced by either separating a 3x3 kernel into two

3. BACKGROUND IN COMPUTER SCIENCE

34

linear 3-element kernel. Therefore, although the time complexity is potentially high, these
techniques are still convenient to use on large sets of data.
Blurring the image by convolving it with a blur kernel reduces minute, noisy, variations in pixel values. Two standard kernels are the box and Gaussian kernels. The box
kernel averages a pixel with its neighbors (Eq. 3.1.3). The Gaussian kernel also averages
a pixel with its neighbors but is more sophisticated because it weighs nearer neighbors
more heavily than more distant ones (Eq. 3.1.4).

The optimal size and shape of the blurring kernel depends on the individual image
data and the scale of the target features that will eventually be extracted. If an image has
high resolution and the features of interest are relatively coarse, the image can be blurred
more dramatically and made easier to process. On the other hand, if the image is low
resolution or a pattern of interest is very fine, too much blurring can obscure the content
of the image.
Just as blurring an image can make it easier to process, transforming an image into
an edge image can also be convenient. Two more useful linear filters are the Sobel, which
detects edges and a corner detector . The Sobel kernel detects differences between adjacent
pixels (Eq. 3.1.5). It can be oriented different ways to detect edges that run in different
directions. Corners are slightly more advanced features to use for image transform, but
can still be captured with linear filtering (Eq. 3.1.6).

Making an image binary can make it easier to process because the set of pixel values
is reduced to {0,255}, in other words a lot of noise has been removed from the signal. For
features such as edges, shapes, contours and objects the relevant information is the absence
or presence of a feature in the image, not its qualities. Therefore, a binary representation
suffices. An image can be made binary using a threshold function, θ, such that any pixel,
p, with a value above the threshold, t, will be reassigned to 255 and any pixel with a value
below the threshold will be assigned to 0 (Eq 3.1.7).

Using variations on binary images, for example pixels above the threshold keep their
original value, images can be made into tool such as masks that remove background. The
biggest challenge in transforming an image to binary is deciding on the threshold value.
There may be scenarios when the threshold is easily decided from the content of the images,
but often the goal is to have a binary image that maintains as much contour and shape
information from the original image as possible and no other parameters are known. For
this, the optimal threshold depends on the composition of an image in particular. There
are algorithms to determine an optimal threshold. For example, the Otsu method uses
descriptive statistics of an image’s histogram to choose an optimal threshold (Eq. 3.1.8).
The method aims to find two distributions within the histogram, q1 , q2 , one representing
lower values and one representing higher values. It is designed to work best on bimodal
images. It chooses a threshold, t that minimizes the variance, σ12 , σ22 , within each half of

3. BACKGROUND IN COMPUTER SCIENCE

36

the image [Szeliski, 2010, Beghdadi et al., 2013]. In this way, the threshold can be tailored
to each image upon which it is imposed.

(3.1.8)

Blurring can remove noise, but it also lessens the sharpness of an image. Often, it is
desirable to remove noise form an image while keeping it sharp. A combination of erosion
and dilation can work to remove specks of noise while sharpening boarders, significant
edges and contours at the same time. Erosion and dilation are reciprocal procedures. Both
convolve the image, f , with a kernel, s where S is the size of s, and can be represented by
thresholding functions, σ. In erosion, the kernel calculates the minimum value of all the
pixels within reach (Eq. 3.1.9). In dilation the kernel calculates the maximum value of all
the pixels in its kernel region (Eq. 3.1.10).

erode(f, s) = θ(c, S)

(3.1.9)

dilate(f, s) = θ(c, 1)

(3.1.10)

As consequences of these operations, erosion can shrink the size of an image and
dilation can grow it. However, if the operations are used in succession, the image can
end up relatively the same size as its original by either shrinking the object then growing
(opening) it or vice versa (closing) (Eq 3.1.11 and Eq. 3.1.12).

open(f, s) = dilate(erode(f, s), s)

(3.1.11)

close(f, s) = erode(dilate(f, s), s)

(3.1.12)

3. BACKGROUND IN COMPUTER SCIENCE

37

In a standard black and white image, for example, wherein the background is black
and an object in the image is white, erosion will eliminate noise by counting any noisy
signal and background, and dilation will remove noise by including any noisy signal as
part of the object (Eq. 3.1.1).

removing some of the signal to make it easier to work with. (a) original image, (b) dilation,

With real world data, it is often necessary to remove noise or deal with low-contrast
images [Di Lazzaro et al., 2013, Juang and Wu, 2011]. These pre-processing techniques
make images more susceptible to feature extraction. Ultimately, feature extraction is a
more pivotal part of image processing because it is the step in which semantic content
is derived from raw pixel values. There are many different measures that can be used to
describe an image. Features can be thought of as low level or as high level. Low-level
features are descriptions of the image at the pixel level and include features derived from

3. BACKGROUND IN COMPUTER SCIENCE

38

statistics or from geometric transforms. High-level features are descriptors of the semantic
content of an image and often require the use of heuristics.

3.1.2

Low-level Features
Some common low-level features are related to color. Color features can be extracted

under a grayscale channel, different color channels or an integrated average of color channels. One way to describe a matrix of pixel values (color values) is through first order
statistics (FOS). FOS are measures taken from a set of data, in our case a matrix of pixel
values that do not take into account the arrangement of the data, just the collection of
values. In fact, statistics are often computed from histogram representations of images
(Lei et al.; Lin et al.). They include mean, standard deviation, entropy, third and fourth
moments, among others (Penatti, Valle, and Torres). FOS provide a profile of the images pixel values and can applied to any image so are very universal. They are also very
powerful and have been used to classify diverse image sets (Aggarwal and K Agrawal;
Gonzlez-Rufino et al.).
Texture features, although they are low-level, can account for spacial arrangement.
They aim to capture the changes in pixel values over the image; they measure its landscape. Many texture features try to capture the differences between adjacent or spatially
related pixels or the co-occurrences of pixel values. Directional and gradient information
is often maintained. There are some common feature sets used to capture texture, for
example Harrilack features, co-occurrence matrices, or Laws texture energy measures .
Laws measures are a set of masks that can be convolved with an image in order to detect
various texture patterns. The masks allow FOS to be used to capture texture data by
first transforming the image into a texture image. The masks can be 3, 5 or 7 pixels in
length ad can be multiplied with each other to form two-dimensional kernels. There are

3. BACKGROUND IN COMPUTER SCIENCE

39

masks designed to detect level, edge, spot, and ripple relations between pixels (Eq. 3.1.13,
Eq. 3.1.14 and Eq. 3.1.15) .

Using all of Law’s masks in combination with each other (e.g. Se xSe , Se xSs ) provides a complete texture profile. Texture features are often used for image classification
(Figure 3.1.2). They are more powerful than color features because they retain special information and images can differ greatly in their pixel distribution eve if the set of pixels for
each image is identical [Jeyapoovan and Murugan, 2013, Hosseinpour et al., 2014, Kistner
et al., 2013, Ursani et al., 2008]. Color and texture features are often used in combination
as they account for complementary and not overlapping information about an images pixel
value profile and pixel spacial distribution respectively [?, Penatti et al., 2012]. These low
level features are universal and have been used to classify images in many fields including
medicine, microscopy and food production [?,Jeyapoovan and Murugan, 2013,Hosseinpour
et al., 2014].
Edges are another low level feature. They are yet more specific than texture. Edges
are simple features of an image, but they can indicate objects and highlight the differences
in image composition and are used as to classify images [Stehling et al., 2002]. An extension
of edge detection is line detection. Because the kernels used in to detect edges are local,
they do not look for continuous lines but rather points of local contrast. The Hough Line
Transform can detect straight lines in an edge image [Szeliski, 2010]. The quantity, angles

and locations of lines can be informative. The Hough Line transform goes through every
possible line parametrized by slope and relation to the origin. If there is an edge pixel
present on the line, that line receives a vote. A threshold can be set to determine the
number of votes needed before a line is detected. Similarly to detecting straight lines,
the Hough Circle transforms and detects circular edges within an image where circles are
parametrized by a radius and coordinates for a center, (x,y). In the transform, every point
on an edge corresponds to a circle in the resulting image. In the final image, circles are
determined by the points where circles intersect (Figure. 3.1.3).
The Hough Circle transform detects circles at any position with any radius. The
Hough Circle Transform is considered low-level feature because it does not require any
heuristics. However, it tends to describe objects and shapes in images providing higher

level content information. There are many more low-level transforms that can capture
different qualities of a picture but extend beyond this introduction [Orlov et al., 2008].

3.1.3

High-Level Features
High-level features are measures of semantic content in an image. They can be more

descriptive because they are tailored to the data set at hand, but they are also less universal
and it is usually harder to extract. One method to extract high level features is template
matching. In template matching, a mask contains an image or segment of an image that
one hopes to find in the image being analyzed. This template can be convolved with an
image. At each step, the difference is computed between the pixels of the image and the
pixels of the template. The regions that have a high similarity to the template constitute
detection [Szeliski, 2010]. The feature extracted form a detection even could be presence

3. BACKGROUND IN COMPUTER SCIENCE

42

or absence, or as a feature of the location of the item of interest. Different sized templates
can be used to detect objects of different scales.
Another type of high-level feature is the measure of connected components. Connected components can divide an image up into its different parts. These parts can then
be counted or compared to each other, their locations or sizes can be marked as features,
or they can be used as masks of a region of interest. To get a good feature out of connected
components analysis, one would likely have to know what type of components to expect
and how to expect those components to vary between images. One study used components
of an eye to detect retinal blastoma. The researchers divided the eye into connected parts
and then measures the components relative sizes and positions to find abnormalities that
helped diagnose cancer Haleem:2013ej.
A Fourier transform can be used to describe an oscillating pattern in an image.
Fourier analysis can determine the frequency of the signal in the image, which is an
indication of the variation within the image. A two-dimensional Fourier transform an also
determine the periods of signals projecting in different orientations throughout an image
(Figure 3.1.4). This trait would be clearly seen and only substantially useful, in images
with horizontal or vertical striation.
The Hough Circle transform can detect smooth, round circles but, in images, round
objects are often not perfectly round but rather they are generally round in shape. A highlevel feature could explore the intricacies of contours that are irregular. For example, the
convexity of a contour provides a measure of its smoothness. Convexity can be measured
when a contour can provide a convex hull in an image and then the defects that are in that
contour can be quantified. One way to do this for a circular contour is by measuring the
variation in radii length for different angles around the center of the circle (Figure 3.1.5).
This feature can be extracted using a lot of the same techniques used to gather low-level

3. BACKGROUND IN COMPUTER SCIENCE

43

Figure 3.1.4. A Fourier transform can determine the frequency of a signal in an image,
which can be a useful high-level feature. (A) original image, (B) two-dimensional Fourier
transform, (D) one-dimensional slice where peaks indicate the period of the original signal.

features but convexity constitutes a high-level feature because it is only useful if images
are known to have contours and potential convex-hull elements.

3.1.4

Image Segmentation
Image segmentation is often used to extract content away from a background before

features are collected. This ensures that any feature data is only of the subject and not
background artifacts. Image segmentation separates the foreground from the background,
focusing the analysis on the content-based objects. Often heuristics provide an idea of what
these foreground shapes will be, but low-level features can also be used for backgroundforeground segmentation.
Color can be used to distinguish a background from a foreground. Grouping methods
such as K-means analysis or mean-shift methods can find regions of similar colors and

determine distinctions between objects and background [Huang and Zeng, 2015, OrosPeusquens et al., 2011,Zheng et al., 2014]. Texture can also be used to separate an image. If
a texture mask is applied to an image, the result can be subjected to the same methods used
upon color-based segmentation [Lee et al., 2006, Ursani et al., 2008]. Image segmentation
often uses features of an entire image in order to find a submatrix within that image so
that features can be re-extracted from a more salient region of the image.

3.2 Clustering
Image processing can result in large sets of data. Images can be relatively large
matrices and many features can be extracted from a single image. Further, sets of images
can be large. After image data has been transformed into feature vectors, it can be a

3. BACKGROUND IN COMPUTER SCIENCE

45

challenge to analyze the data set. Clustering techniques can be used to automatically
analyze large sets of data.
Clustering is used in many branches of science and social sciences. Some of the
earliest clustering algorithms emerged for analyzing sociological data. These data sets
included mostly categorical data. Clustering has grown to be used with numerical and
heterogeneous data sets as well.
There are different methods of clustering, but all share the basic goal of separating
a data set in order to optimize the ratio of intra-group variation to inter-group variation.
In other words, to find a pattern inherent in a data set. On one extreme, if every element
in a data set were placed in its own group, it would have perfectly minimal intra-group
variation and the pattern would be very fine grained. On the other extreme, if all the data
points were one of two possible values, they would have the maximal inter-group variation
and the pattern would be very corse. Clustering methods aim to find an optimal balance
between the two.
Data sets can be looked at from different perspectives. Hierarchical clustering is a
top-down perspective that combines the data in tiers, like a tree. Partition based clustering
is a bottom up approach that initially divides the data into clusters and then adjusts the
membership of those clusters.

3.2.1

Hierarchical Clustering
Hierarchical clustering successively combines data into decreasingly similar groups

and thus assumes there is a branched, tree-like structure to the data set. It determines
clusters using pair-wise difference measures between all the elements in a data set. Upon
initialization, each element belongs to its own cluster. Clusters are then successively combined until only a single cluster remains [Murtagh, 1983](Algorithm 3.2.1).

♦
There are different ways for determining which clusters to combine, for example

partial, single or average linkage update formula. Wards method uses an update formula,σ,
based on variation within the possible combination of clusters, c1 and c2 (Eq. 3.2.3)
between clusters [Murtagh, 1983] (Eq. 3.2.1). It chooses the cluster pair to merge that
minimizes the cumulative distance between each element in a cluster. The update formula
can be based on heuristics of the problem at hand, if they are known, but Ward’s is a
standard that can be generically applied.

δ(c1 , c2 ) =

|c1 ||c2 |
||c1 − c2 ||2
|c1 | + |c2 |

(3.2.1)

An advantage of hierarchical clustering is that the final number of clusters does not
need to be known a priori. However, after the algorithm is finished, it has to be decided
which clades of the tree will be considered clusters. This can be done with dissimilarity
measures and statistical tests, like the Students t-test, that determine when clades are
significantly different from their ancestors .

3. BACKGROUND IN COMPUTER SCIENCE

47

This method is very costly because of determining the pair-wise dissimilarity matrix,
which is O(N 2 ). However, implementations that use reciprocal nearest-neighbor algorithms
based on graph and sub-graph representations of the data set speed up the algorithm
[Murtagh, 1983]. Hierarchical clustering is especially useful on smaller sets of data that
have a more intricate architecture that involves different levels of similarity.

3.2.2

Partition-based Clustering
One of the most widely used partition-based clustering algorithms is the k-means

algorithm. The k-means clustering algorithm was introduced by MacQueen in 1967 as an
economical solution for problems involving the classification of multi-variant observations
(MacQueen 1967). It divides a data set into k clusters where k must be specified by the
user. Its relative simplicity likely contributed to its popularity and, today, it is a standard
algorithm used in image processing. A common version of k-means is an iterative k-means
such that the algorithms repeats until convergence and no elements are assigned to a new
centroid in the last iteration (Algorithm 3.2.2).

The simplest version of k-means initializes its centroids at k random points within
the feature space of the problem. The results of a k-means clustering are influenced by
the initial centroid locations because the solution can converge at local maxima [Bubeck
et al., 2013]. To overcome this bias, one could repeat a k-means partition, choosing random centroids each time. This would prevent random error from determining the results,
but could be costly in computing time. Some methods aim to distribute initial centroids
in dense areas of the data [Celebi et al., 2013] . Others place centroids in different Gaussian distributions within the data. One finds centroids by finding the axis with the most
variance and initializing centroids at successive medians [Alrabea et al., 2013]. Further,
k-means can be combined with other algorithms like, hierarchical clustering, in order to
overcome the sensitivity to local optima [Liao et al., 2013] . Methods to initialize centroids
are still being explored [Celebi et al., 2013,El Agha and M Ashour, 2012]. There are lots of
different methods developed to initialize centroids, but none as ubiquitous as the original
k-means algorithm itself.
When using the k-means method it is important to consider its limitations. The
algorithm itself is O(N k ) because at each iteration the distance between each element
and centroid must be taken. Time can also be increased when many values of k are
experimented with. Note that k is fixed and so the algorithm is essentially linear. Further,
although not significant in Big O terms, there is a coefficient of t where t is the number
of iterations. Practically, a limit can be places on the number of iterations and k-means
can be efficiently applied to large sets of data. The restrictions on k and t make k-means
an efficient clustering option.

3. BACKGROUND IN COMPUTER SCIENCE

49

K-means has been used widely in image processing. It is used to cluster data represented by feature vectors. Images also inherently have patterns in them otherwise they are
just random pixel values. Since clustering methods attempt to find inherent patterns, and
images most likely contain patterns, they are a natural pair. It can be used for standard
challenged like image segmentation and movement detection [?]. In these scenarios k-means
is applied to cluster sections of an image. K-means has also been used to cluster images
based on higher-level feature values and is used in image retrieval and recognition [Stehling
et al., 2002] . As long as images can be represented by feature vectors either direct pixel
values or extracted features then they can be subjected to k-means clustering.
One strength of k-means is its generality and how widely applicable it is. It is used
in fields as diverse as, social science, health science, and computer vision. In complicated
real-world problems, it is often a solution to a sub-problem and used with other tools. It
is common because there is often no training data available and so it is used to explore,
maybe early stages of a study.
Clustering is often supported by other methods of analysis. For example, hierarchical
k-means clustering algorithms are designed to harness the strengths of both methods
[Liao et al., 2013]. Two clustering methods can be used in tandem in order to boost our
confidence in the results. Or k-means can be used with other classification techniques,
such as supervised machine learning [Zheng et al., 2014] . These ensemble methods can
be bundled into new versions of k-means (e.g. warped k-means, k-means with gravitation,
iterative Fischer, and constrained k-means) [Clausi, 2002,Hu et al., 2008,Leiva and Vidal,
2013]. The breadth of different k-means variants is beyond the scope of this review, but
the fact that that breadth exists speaks to the utility of k-means as a tool

Feature Weighting
An inherent limitation to clustering solutions is the reality of the data; some data

sets will be more homogenous than others. Of course, in real-world problems, this measure
of usefulness is also a measure of the usefulness of the feature variables used to cluster and
thus the efficacy of the clustering alone is not obvious. Clustering seeks to find architectures
in data, but it cannot create them if the do not exist. Because there is often noise in realworld data sets, clustering algorithms can be augmented to be more robust.
Feature weighting can be used to encourage patterns to emerge from data. Modifications of clustering algorithms have been written to factor different features with different
weights [Modha, 2003, Cordeiro de Amorim and Mirkin, 2012]. In particular, one method
gives increased weight to features that show the most variance between clusters [Huang
et al., 2005]. Weighting such a feature more heavily makes it more likely that a cluster
will form around the pattern exhibited by that single feature. Since that feature is chosen
because it varies in different clusters well, the final clusters will be more likely to have
that strong variance reflected in its final variance. This method could be useful to prevent
relatively uniformly distributed features, or noise, from clouding cluster architectures.

3.2.4

Assessing Clustering Solutions
In order to assess a clustering solution, one can look at intra and inter class varia-

tion. Sum of squared error (SSE) is a difference measure for all clusters, Ci of clustering
solution based off of Euclidean distance that can be used to calculate variation between
two points, i and j in p dimensional space (Eq. 3.2.2 and Eq. 3.2.3)The percent of the
total variation explained by the inter-class variation provides a numerical measure of the
solutions strength. Some measures of a successful clustering solution are a low intra to
interclass variation ratio or a high inter to total variation ratio. However, even examining

3. BACKGROUND IN COMPUTER SCIENCE

51

these numbers has a limit to its usefulness because there is no standard of good and bad
clusters; the optimal solution depends on the data being worked on.

When used to solve real-world problems, clustering solutions can also be assessed
by their usefulness: whether the partitions created have some practical, functional value
specific to the task at hand. This is not so easy if the data set is completely foreign, but
often in real-world problems, heuristics exists that help one know whether the clusters are
useful.

3.3 Support Vector Machines
In the late 1970s, a Russian mathematician, named Vapnick, worked to solve the
generalized pattern recognition problem. Many scientists were working on this problem
because of its utility and challenge; the aim was to successfully categorize data without
predefined criteria for classification. Using statistical learning theory, Vapnik put forth a
method that would automatically learn the criteria of classification from sets of labeled
data.
The Support Vector Machine (SVM) is a supervised machine learning tool that
uses statistical information to solve classification problems. As a supervised technique,
the SVM requires a training set of data complete with data points and their labels. It
can then generalize the differences between elements of different classes and assign labels
to novel, unlabeled data. The SVM is powerful because it can learn a trend from a small
sample of data and generalize that trend to never before seen data. The SVM finds the

3. BACKGROUND IN COMPUTER SCIENCE

52

hyper plane in feature space that best separates the classes of the training data. It is easy to
visualize this process for the binary classification of two-dimensional data, assuming data
points have two features (x and y) (Figure 3.3.1). The SVM finds the line that separates
the data points in the two classes from each other and has the widest margins, in Euclidian
distance) from the individuals closest to the hyperplane, which are called support vectors.

Figure 3.3.1. A Support Vector Machine finds the hyperplane that bests divides a set of
pre-labeled data using only the points closest to the hyperplane. [Ben-Hur and Weston,
2009]

The ingenuity of the SVM lies in its use of support vectors, the points closest to
the hyper plane, to determine the optimal separating hyper plane. Maximizing the distances from these margins thus maximizes the distances between the groups at large. Soft
margins are implemented in SVMs so that outlying data can be weighted lightly and effectively ignored (and thus mis-classified) for the betterment of the classifier at large. C is
a parameter that controls this. Because of this, the SVM is immune to outlier data that
can cause over-fitting and make a classifier too specific and not applicable to unseen data.

3. BACKGROUND IN COMPUTER SCIENCE

53

The SVM is a good tool for classifying linearly separable data because good hyper
planes exist between the classes. However, the SVM can be applied to non-linear data as
well. Kernels have been developed to transpose data separated by a higher order functions
onto a linear hyper plane. In addition to the linear kernel there are polynomial, Gaussian
radial bias and spline kernels (Figure 3.3.2). Often it is difficult to know which kernel best
fits a data set so different kernels need to be experimented with and compared to each
other.

Figure 3.3.2. Kernels can transpose data that is not linearly separable into linear space so
that it can be analyzed by an SVM. [Ben-Hur and Weston, 2009]

In addition to classification, SVMs can be expanded to multiway classification.
Multi-class classification problems can be redesigned as a series of binary classification
problems. The ordering and particulars of these binary classifications may depend on the
specific classification problem. A common technique is a series of 1 vs. ALL tests that

3. BACKGROUND IN COMPUTER SCIENCE

54

train on each group vs. the other groups combined . Integrated algorithms for one-step
multi-class SVMs have also been developed [Gidudu Anthony and Tshilidzi, ].
The statistical theory that inspired SVMs has been adapted for unsupervised learning in the form of Novelty Detection or one-class SVMs [Hyduke and Palsson, 2010]. Single
class SVM uses a kernel, usually radial, to determine a distribution within a feature space.
The distribution can be trained on a single class of data, and elements that fall within
that distribution in test data are classified as part of that class. Similarly to two-class
SVM, this is sensitive to the parameters associated with the kernel shape(in the case of
a radial kernel, nu controls sensitivity) and C, the penalty parameter. Unlike clustering
methods, the one-class SVM allows for unsupervised learning that only classifies a subset
of the data. The solution does not need to take into account the architecture of the whole
data set, it can just find a pattern within it. When you have a class and elements that
dont belong to that class, but you know there is variability in those elements, and they
likely should separate from each other, a classic binary SVM approach would not be ideal
because the distribution on one side of the hyperplane will be too variable.
The performance of an SVM can be assessed by the number of correct and incorrect
classifications. These include true positives and true negatives compared to false positives
and false negatives. Because SVMs are supervised and require a set of labeled data, that
data can be used for assessment. Often the data is divided into a training set and a test
set. It is also common to analyze performance through cross-validation accuracy wherein
a small subset of the labeled data is held out for training and testing is applied to the rest
repeatedly selecting different subsets of data to hold-out. Grid search uses cross validation
accuracy to assess the performance of SVMs that are run on the same data with a ranges of
parameters.SVMs can be very sensitive to parameters C, gamma and others. Grid search
is a common algorithm to help determine the most useful parameters. There are extensive
theories on how best to optimize an SVM [Shawe-Taylor and Sun, 2011].The results of

3. BACKGROUND IN COMPUTER SCIENCE

55

grid search are one dimensional if a linear kernel and two-dimensional taking into account
the parameter of the kernel. Grid search runs SVMs with ranges of parameters and return
the parameter set with the highest cross-validation accuracy.
With the ever-increasing presence of the internet and importance of computer vision
and image analysis, the SVM is frequently utilized to classify images. An image that is
represented as a vector of features or, equivalently, a point in multi-dimensional feature
space is susceptible to SVM classification. In real world applications, there is not often a
problem ’clean’ enough that a traditional two-class SVM is enough to provide interesting
results. Often, like k-means, SVMs are used in compound ways or in conjunction with
other classification methods to build ensemble classifiers. Two SVMs were used on the
same set of images, one to classify based on low level features and one to classify based on
high level features and then the results of the two machines were combined in a weighted
manner in order to make the final decisions on the image classes [Qi and Han, 2006]. There
have even been pipelines involving four machines Saha:dc. SVMs have been adapted for
multi-way classification using a series of one vs. all classifiers; the supervised SVM technique is beginning to be combined with unsupervised k-means clustering deNazareSilva:gh.
The complexity inherent in many real-world computer vision and image processing tasks
requires the creative use of the SVM tool.
The power of an SVM to classify large amounts of data makes it a good tool for
handling image data, including that from high-throughput functional assays, especially
those that collect image data. Although images of a microbial mutant library do not come
with labeled data and cannot be immediately classified by an SVM, once a phenotype of
interest has been identified, an SVM can be used to quickly screen an entire library for
similar mutants. This is critical, especially when working with saturation libraries, in order
to collect all possible genes that contribute to a complex trait, such as biofilm. Tools like
clustering and SVMs allow for the exploration of an organism from the point of view of

3. BACKGROUND IN COMPUTER SCIENCE

56

an interesting phenotype instead of a single gene. This allows for more useful and efficient
exploration of genomes such as those from environmental isolates.

4
Materials and Methods

4.1 Medias and Strains
Environmental isolates and transposon mutants were maintained on TGHL agar
(0.2% lactose, 0.4% gelatin, 1.6% tryptone, and 1% agar) plates at 22o C and stored at
−80o C in 25% v/v glycerol and R2A (0.31% VWE R2A mix) stocks. During selection
for transposon insertion, TGHL was supplemented with kanamycin in 45 45 mg/mL. E.
coli strain DH5αλpir was maintained on LB (0.5% NaCl, 0.5% yeast, 1% tryptone and
1.5% agar). supplemented with Km45 and incubated at 37o C. Swimming and swarming
motility assays were amended with 0.3% and 0.5% agar, respectively.

4.2 Genomics
Next generation Illumina technology was used to sequence whole genomes. Specifically, sequencing was done on a MiSeq with 100 bp paired-end reads. Resulting reads
were assembled into contigs using MIRA (Mimicking Intelligent Read Assembly), annotated with RAST (Rapid Annotation Using Subsystems Technology) and visualized and

4. MATERIALS AND METHODS

58

subjected to comparative analysis in the SEED viewer. BLAST (Basic Local Alignment
Search Technology) search was used to further explore genomics.

4.3 Mutagenesis
E coli strain WM1590 was used as a donor strain in conjugation. Mating strains were
struck out onto LB agar plates and incubated at 22o C for 48 hours. Resulting colonies
were then suspended in R2A broth and diluted to a 2.5 McFarland, 100µl of culture were
plated onto R2A/Km45 plates and the rest of cells were centrifuged for 3 minutes at 13,000
rpm, re-suspended in 200µl R2A and spread with beads onto R2A/Km45 plates.

4.4 Biofilm Morphology Assay
From selection plates, 24 hour old colonies were transferred to 100µl R2A/Km45
broth, incubated at 22o C , shaking for 48 hours then plated in 2µl samples onto square
TGHL plates in a 6 by 8 pattern. Liquid cultures of each environmental isolate and mutant
were brought to 25% glycerol and frozen at −80o C . Plates with lids removed were scanned
after 3,4 and 5 days on an Epson300 flatbed scanner with a white background at 1200 dpi
in jpeg format.

4.5 Image Segmentation
Scans of the mutant libraries were processed with scripts written in C++ using the
OpenCV library. The original color images were converted to grayscale, eroded, dilated,
blurred and then converted too binary images using the Otsu method. The Hough Circle
Transform was used to detect colonies within the image (minimum distance: 400, edge detection threshold: 250, center detection threshold: 25, minimum radius: 100 and maximum:
250). The boundaries of sub-matrices were determined by the detected Hough circles with

4. MATERIALS AND METHODS

59

a padding of 20 pixels in each direction, except for edge cases, which were cut off at the
boundary of the image. Sub-matrices were saved as individual images.

4.6 Feature Collection
Five sets of features were collected: colony features, color features, texture features,
convexity features and Fourier transform features (Figure 4.6.1).

T = {LxL, ExE, SxS, SxE, LxE, LxS, ExS, ExL, SxL}, and i ∈ T .
Additionally, the path to the described image was included as a feature in each set
of features (but not used for clustering or classification). The set of features was a comma
separated value (csv) sheet generated by iostream output from C++ scripts. The feature
set was loaded into R as a data frame. This data frame was normalized to values between
0 and 1 according to the function where and D is the data frame, and Y is the set of
FileName features (Eq. 4.6.1).

f (x) =

x − min(D)
max(D) − min(D)

(4.6.1)

4.7 Feature Selection
All sets of features, (colony features, color features, texture features, convexity features and Fourier transform features) were used in all combinations in the k-means method
from the cluster library in R. Further, weighted k-means clustering solutions were also explored using R libraries. In all cases, k was chosen manually by computing results for k
values from 2 to 25 and then selecting smallest k that still provided a steep reduction,
noticeable by eye, in SSE from k-1.

4.8 Clustering and Classification
Clustering and classification based on the csv data sets were performed in R. Workflow went from a library of mutants to a group of mutants that share a phenotype of

interest in a semiautomated way (Figure 4.8.1). Libraries were used when appropriate for
data normalization, k-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, SVM learning and data
visualization (Table 4.8.1). The k-means algorithm resulted in clusters that were manually analyzed. Ransom samples were analyzed for colonies that looked similar, different,
or obscured by artifacts. Each cluster in each solution was scored based on the maximum
number of colonies that could be considered in a group, the number of colonies with plating artifacts, the number of colonies with typing over their images and the number of
images that did not contain an colony. Clusters whose random sample of 24 elements was
mostly images with numbers, missed colonies or plating artifacts were removed from the
working data. The full data set was cleaned of mutants that resemble WT using one-class
SVM novelty detection (radial kernel, gamma = 0.01, cost = 10, nu = 0.0001 ). The data
was clustered by the k-means method and resulting clusters of interest were subsequently
subjected to Wards hierarchical method (and bootstrap difference measures) when appropriate. A final resulting cluster was chosen as a focus group and an SVM was trained in
two-way classification between the focus group and WT. This SVM was used to predict
the classification of the original, entire data set. Grid search provided the parameters for
SVM and a linear kernel was used (linear kernel, gamma = 0.03125, cost = 1).

4.9 Assessment
Clusters were assessed by intra and inter cluster variance, with intra class variance
normalized by the c luster size. Random subsamples of 24 elements from each cluster
were analyzed manually (Table 4.9.1). Clusters were scored using quality statistics: Point
Biserial Correlation (PBC), Huberts Gamma(HG), Average Silhouette width (ASW), R2
(R2) , and Huberts Coefficient (HC) as described in the WeightedClustering in R manual.
Values were computed using the WeightClustering library in R. SVM results were analyzed
by 10-fold cross validation accuracy and tested on a manually labeled data set of 100
elements.

5.1 BJB312 Genome Assembly and Annotation
The BJB312 genome shows 403 different subsystems. Genes suggest motility, antibiotic and metal resistance, antibiotic production, polysaccharide production and excretion,
and cAMP signaling. The three most prevalent subsystems are carbohydrates, amino acids
and derivates and protein metabolism. Stress response, motility and membrane transport
were also clearly present.

Comparative Genomics
BJB312 showed varying similarity to genomes of BJB1 or BJB302, other violacein-

genome can also be looked at in comparison to genomes from available databases. The
gene of BJB312 more closely resembles that of J. lividum relative to J. marseille and
E. coli (Figure 5.1.2). It has been classified as a strain of Janthinobacterium sp. based
on genome similarity. However, many of its close neighbors in various genuses including

Genes of Interest
The v io operon was found in the genome of BJB312 in a BLAST result (Figure 5.1.3).

All five genes, v ioABCDE are present, spanning two contigs. This is the same operon found
in all known violacein producers.
In addition to the presence of violacein genes, genes relating to biofilm were identified
(Table 5.1.2). These genes have known roles in EPS production, flagellar motility and Type
II secretion systems and suggest a system of biofilm production and regulation.

5.2 Functional Assays with BJB312
BJB312 is an environmentally isolated strain of bacteria. It is a Gram negative
bacterium isolated from fresh water in the Hudson Valley region of NY state. In order
to observe colony morphology and behavior, BJB312 was examined on a variety of media
types. BJB312 forms biofilm pellets in static liquid cultures of LB, TGHL, 1% Tryptone
and R2A broth (Figure 5.2.1). It produces biofilm when grown in shaking liquid cultures

5. RESULTS

68

(220 rmp) in LB, TGHL, and tryptone broth. The violacein production in R2A liquid
cultures is subtle. On agar plates it produces violacein in a similar pattern across media
types (Figure 5.2.2 and Figure 5.2.3). On TGHL it appears particularly rugose. BJB312
spread widely on TGHL and R2A swimming motility plates and TGHL swarming motility
plates. On other swarm and swim motilities it shows only growth and moderate swarming
(Figure 5.2.4 and Figure 5.2.5).

5.3 Image Segmentation
Images of individual bacterial colonies were successfully isolated from scans containing up to 288 colonies. The scans were susceptible to the Otsu method of binaryization.
Further, the near-circular shapes of the colonies proved to be circular enough for the Hough
Circle transform (Figure 5.3.1). The collected image library had a true positive value or
82.26% and a positive predictive value of 56.95%. Additionally, 238 true-positive images
of BJB312 were extracted from a scan containing 288 colonies.

5.4 Clustering Solutions

Machine Learning Filters
The k-means filter revealed 9 clusters that were removed from the working data

sets GDBk and GDBks . These clusters were rich with numbers and plating mistakes
(Figure 5.4.2). A one-class SVM that was trained on images of WT, BJB312 colonies
classified 1117 of the GDB mutants as WT, 2696 as mutant and 468 as NA. The removal
of these mutants led to the determination of data set GDBs and, in part, GDBks.

K-means Solutions PCA
When data sets of unrefined data (GDB), data refined by k-means (GDBk ), data

refined by SVM (GDBs ) and data refined by both SVM and k-means (GDBks ) were
subjected to k-means clustering with 25 centroids, they resulted in different solutions.
The differences in the architectures observed via principle component analysis differ in
the distribution of clusters. The double refined data solution does not display an outlier
in a way similar to the other solutions (Figure 5.4.4).

The clustering solutions from refined data are superior according to statistical qual-

ity measures: Point Biserial Correlation (PBC), Huberts Gamma(HG), Average Silhouette
width (ASW), R2 (R2) , and Huberts Coefficient (HC) (Table 5.4.1). The clustering solution from data refined by SVM had the highest score for PBC and HG as well as the
lowest score for HC. The solution from doubly refined data had the highest score for ASW
and R2. For all scores, the unrefined data did the poorest, that is, it had the lowest score
for PBC, HG, ASW, and R2 and the highest score for HC. According to all measures,
refined data led to a solution that outperformed that from raw data.

A two class SVM that was trained on images of WT BJB312 and mutants of the
biofilm-defect cluster detected 276 mutants as biofilm deficient. The performance of this
machine can be evaluated by its cross validation accuracy of 99.7%. Further, its performance is demonstrated when it is applied to a set of manually labeled data. Out of a set of
100 samples, it correctly identified 15 as biofilm mutants and 59 as other and it incorrectly
labeled 8 as biofilm mutants and 18 as other.

biofilm. Some of the five also showed corresponding decrease in violacein production in
shaking liquid cultures. One mutant showed increase violacein production. Five of the
same mutants exhibited smooth biofilms when plated on LB and TGHL. All strains,
including BJB312, were smooth on 1% Tryptone and had minimal growth and violacein
production on R2A. One mutant showed hyper wrinkled on 1% Tryptone. Three mutants
exhibited abnormal swimming motility than BJB312 on LB. One mutant, shows a lack of
violacein production in TGHL. Some of these mutants show less swarming motility, but it
is not very dramatic due to BJB312s lack of swarming activity. In summary, the mutants
differed noticeably from BJB312 in terms of their profile across medias in biofilm, pellet
and violacein-production assays. There was no clear loss-of-function trends in the mutants
with respect to swimming or swarming motility (Figurer̃efbehaviors).

Discussion

6.1 Genomics
According to RAST, the nearest neighbor of BJB312 was J. marseille. This was
surprising because J. marseille does not produce violacein. It is likely the case that there
is no well documented genome of a J. lividum strain in the database used by RAST, but
that BJB312 is in fact closer to J. lividum. It would be interesting to compare the genome
of BJB312 to a range of j. lividum strains including available genomes such as HH01 and
environmental isolates like BJB1. HH01 has been the subject of previous investigations
in to J. lividum and could provide direction and comparative tools for the exploration of
BJB312 [Hornung et al., 2013]. As violacein becomes more studies, there will likely need
to be a more intricate taxonomy for these specific types of bacteria.
The genes of interest that were found int he BJB312 genome were related to EPS,
cdGMP, quorum sensing, flagella and T2SS. Although these are different systems, they
all interact with each other. Biofilm and motility are reciprocally regulated, likely by
the cdGMP pathways [Lee et al., 2007]. Quorum sensing also seems to playa role in the
program of violacein production and biofilm formation [Stauff and Bassler, 2011, Sakuragi

6. DISCUSSION

94

and Kolter, 2007]. Perhaps a future study on this library could use different features of
images, or different assays, to keep track of phenotypes related to these different systems
to study their interaction.

6.2 Mutant Library
Hand plating led to artifacts and unusable colonies. For example, one of the mating
had nearly half white mutants. This is most likely contamination. As the library was built
by hand, this isnt too unexpected. We could have automated this screen with a robot. More
realistically, we could have maintained the library on a BJB312-specific antibiotic, like
ampicillin. However, growth on antibiotics may affect the phenotype of the bacteria and
select for a phenotype that is specifically resistant. We also could have done the matings
in a hood. In general, batches with contamination should be excluded from the study,
but because image processing didnt capture color-less colonies anyway, the contaminants
didnt make it into the image library.
I combined two mutant libraries. They were of the same strain and the same transposon, but were plated by different people and scanned at different ages. Additionally, there
were done on different media. This might be something to control for, but also shows the
utility of the tool. It can be used to go back over a library, or augment a library. New
questions can be asked about the same image library in that different phenotypic groups
can be focused on, not just biofilm. New assays can be done and screened with ease and
speed, for example motility or media, QS, response to salt etc.
Ultimately, my library could have been larger and more controlled. Given that
BJB312 has about 5,000 genes in its genome, a very rough estimate is that I would need
around 57,000 mutants to approach saturation [Phogot et al., 2001]. However, the machine
learning methods I used seem more successful in light of the noisiness of my data; if they
were applied to cleaner data I can imagine their performance increasing.

6. DISCUSSION

95

6.3 Biofilm Cluster
The mutants that were subjected to extensive functional assays were not those from
the reported most successful cluster. They were from a cluster gathered in more preliminary clustering. Im not sure if this should be in the discussion, but it should be noted.
Clearly, a further step in this experiment would be to examine the mutants from the
most successful clusters as well as those classified as potentially similar. They would be
subjected to functional assays, for example liquid biofilm assays, QS, temperature preference, and then sequenced. The next step in molecular biology would be clean deletions of
genes of interest that were revealed though this too [Pelicic et al., 1997]. This is a more
sophisticated way to determine gene function and ultimately allows us to modify isolates
to combat chytrid better.

6.4 Image Processing
6.4.1

Image Segmentation
The method of image segmentation from far from ideal. Because I hand tuned the

Hough Circle parameters to specify a radius range the a range of circles per image, it
worked OK. However, there was low yield and certainly false positives. Better segmentation techniques, like the watershed method, could have improved the accuracy of image
segmentation and collected a cleaner more complete image library.

6.4.2

Image Features
There have been extensive comparisons of image features and descriptors and their

usefulness. Most of the features I chose provided usable information, but some (which
ones) either returned a uniform measure or an incomplete data set. Although I looked
at clustering with different combinations of the mutant classes, I could have looked at
combinations of the ungrouped features. Using a weighted k-means approach did not

6. DISCUSSION

96

appear to offer any dramatic difference in clustering solutions, but weighting is certainly
something I could have done and tried more sophisticated methods.

6.5 Machine Learning Filters
6.5.1

K-means filter vs SVM filter
It was interesting to note that the two filtering methods appeared to work quali-

tatively differently. The k-means based filter seemed to remove outliers, as illustrated by
PCA. Further, it increased the average number of ’in’ members in each cluster, but also
increased the number of ’out’ members. On the other hand, the SVM-based filter did not
clearly remove any outliers, but rather thinned out the data to remove dense aggregates.
Also, it reduced the average number of ’out’ members per cluster but also decreased
the number of ’in’ members. When used together, the filters provided both advantages
of increasing the number of ’in’ members and decreasing the number of ’out’ members
compared to those of GDB. This relationship illustrates the qualitative differences and
complimentary utilities of the two filtering methods.

6.5.2

One-class SVM
The one-class SVM was hyper sensitive resulting in a lot of false positive classifica-

tions. This resulted in a very dramatic filtration of the data set. Perhaps there are better
ways to tune the parameters than adjust them so that is classifies approximately half of
the training data as positive. Perhaps a larger WT library would allow for better training.

6.6 Comparing Clustering Solutions
I used statistical metrics to assess my clustering solutions. I also used subjective
measures of biological usefulness. A more complete study would rescue the transposons
from my class of biofilm mutants and sequence them to find out in which genes they have

6. DISCUSSION

97

inserted. At first a proof=of-principle study could look for known biofilm-related genes
and this could validate the computational tools. Later, the tools could be trusted to find
new, unexpected yet relevant genes.

6.7 Further work
The automatic screening tool could be used on other organisms, specifically those
with biomedical significance such as cystic fibrosis colonizers. Biofilm plays a large role in
cystic fibrosis and so it would be natural to extend this tool to look at biofilms in that
species. Alternatively, it could be used to explore Gram positive bacteria. It could even
be used to classify a collection of environmental isolates, they don’t need to be mutants,
just things that we want to find patterns in. This took provides a way to rapidly examine
the phenotypes of a large library of bacteria and begin to make sense of the phenotypic
groups present; it could be used with nearly any microbe and assay.

7
Conclusion

In this study I explored the potential of using image processing and Machine Learning to automatically screen large libraries of mutant bacterial colonies. These automation
methods and this biological challenge seemed like a good pair because the former has
been developed to find patterns in large complex data sets and the later provides exactly
such a data set. Further, the question of how to scan large libraries in the biology laboratory is important because such data sets are currently the bottle-neck in high throughput
experiments.
I built a library of ∼4,000 transposon mutants from the environmental isolate
BJB312. Although this library did not come close to providing saturation of the genome,
it is still the largest library of BJB312 made to date and sufficed as a set of data on which
I could develop automated screening techniques.
Because I was dealing with a real-world data set, the questions of clustering and classification were not straightforward. I used unsupervised and supervised machine learning
techniques to try and extract a phenotypically similar, biologically interesting and comprehensive group of mutants from the library. The phenotype of interest turned out to be

7. CONCLUSION

99

biofilm formation; biofilm was observable in image of the colonies and has important roles
in the characteristic survival and therapeutic potentials of BJB312.
Time prohibited me from re-examine my final group of 276 biofilm mutants with extensive functional assays or genetic sequencing. However, I was able to explore 10 members
of a group of biofilm mutants from a preliminary clustering and classification workflow.
These members displayed differential abnormal phenotypes in assays of biofilm growth on
solid media, pellet formation in liquid media and violacein production in liquid media.
They did not show noticeable motility defects. This study leaves room for much more exploration or engineering a machine learning solution for characterizing images of microbes.
However, these preliminary results suggest that this workflow may prove to be a useful
tool.
