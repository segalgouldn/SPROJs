Abstract
The evolution of the Internet has revolutionized how people acquire information. People
are rapidly and easily locating information online, from students doing research projects to adults
looking for long lost classmates. North America has been dominating with the highest Internet
penetration rate, currently 77.4%. However, the Internet has not proved to be successful with all
demographics; a mere 42% of people aged 65+ are Internet users. Internet usage, particularly for
senior citizens, can be extremely beneficial. One way to achieve a higher percentage of senior
citizen Internet users is to make the Internet more accessible by improving interfaces for
common applications.
The purpose of this study was to compare and examine the usability of three software
programs for senior citizens, as well as the usability of a touch screen interface. A think-aloud
usability study was performed, supplemented by pre and post-surveys, examining the combined
use of touch-screen interfaces and accessibility-enhanced software. The goal was to ascertain
how useful senior citizens find accessibility-enhanced design and how to improve the user
experience.
Time-on-task measurements and user comments suggest the importance of combining
text and image cues in an interface. Time-on-task and mouse click counts suggest the superiority
of flat (non-hierarchical) organization of activities that avoid pop-up windows. Finally,
consistent interface elements help ensure users know where they are within a program,
eliminating a great deal of confusion.

1 Introduction
The evolution of the Internet has revolutionized how people acquire information. People
are rapidly and easily locating information online, from students doing research projects to adults
looking for long lost classmates. The Internet has changed the way people communicate,
rendering phonebooks obsolete [1], and hand-written letters a thing of the past. As of June 30,
2010 there are 1.96 billion Internet users in the world, a yearly growth rate of 17.8% and a world
growth rate of 444.8% over the past decade [2]. North America has been dominating with the
highest Internet penetration rate of 77.4%. Despite this growth, the Internet has not proved to be
successful with all demographics. While 95% of people aged 18-29 are Internet users, and 78%
of adults between the ages of 50 and 64 go online, only 42% of people aged 65+ are Internet
users [4]. Interestingly, the greatest increase in Internet use between 2005 and 2008 falls in the
70-75 age range, where 45% are online, up from 26% [32].
There are numerous reasons why this is the case. A smaller population of senior citizens
using the Internet could be attributed to issues of usability, accessibility, and attitudes, among
other things. According to eMarketer, Internet use has not fully infiltrated the current generation
of adults over 65 because many had retired before Internet access became common in the
workplace [7]. Nevertheless, Internet usage, particularly for senior citizens, can be extremely
beneficial and even raise the quality of life for this population. One way to achieve a higher
percentage of senior citizen Internet users is to make the Internet more accessible by improving
usability. Several software programs, including PointerWare, BigScreenLive, and Eldy, have
been designed specifically to help senior citizens use the Internet efficiently and comfortably.
This project explores how successful these programs are in their mission to be user-friendly for
senior citizens, as well as how they can be improved for better ease of use.

2

2 Background
2.1 Why is it essential that senior citizens get online?
Access to the Internet offers senior citizens numerous benefits. In addition to the benefits
of social networking and connections they can establish with family, friends and old classmates,
the Internet is a powerful tool for information access; it allows elderly individuals to take a more
active role in the health care process and to learn about retirement options, as well as work and
education opportunities [11]. The ability to access reliable online health information has been
linked to a reduction in anxiety, an increase in confidence, and a decrease in utilization of
ambulatory services. Studies have also suggested that Internet use for senior citizens “is
associated with higher levels of social connectivity, higher levels of perceived social support,
decreased feelings of loneliness, lower levels of depression, and generally more positive attitudes
toward aging” [33].
Senior citizens have the power to enhance their independence by utilizing online services
such as banking, shopping, and healthcare management, and pursuing leisure activities including
recreation and communication using the Internet [37]. A large scale study, “Internet Use and
Depression Among the Elderly,” which examined survey responses from 7,000 senior citizens,
revealed that spending time online reduces depression by 20% for this demographic [36].

2.2 What are the challenges for Senior Citizens
As humans reach the age of 65 and older, normal physical and cognitive limitations arise
that hinder the ability to use technology. Even though today’s older adults are healthier than
previous generations, the likelihood of developing a disability still increases with age and many
older people have at least one chronic condition. According to the Pew Internet and American
Life Report in 2004, senior citizens with disabilities are less likely to use technology such as
computers and the Internet [30].

3
2.2.1

Physical Limitations

The most common physical change that occurs due to the aging process is worsening of
vision, which includes but is not limited to “reductions in the amount of light that reaches the
retina, loss of contrast sensitivity, and loss of the ability to detect fine details” [8]. This creates
difficulty with small text size and color perception [9].
Many older adults also experience a decline in hearing ability, as well as changes in
motor skills including slower response times, disruptions in coordination, and loss of flexibility
[30]. Difficulties with motor skills result in trouble using input devices such as the mouse and
keyboard.
2.2.2

Cognitive Limitations

The likelihood of developing a cognitive impairment also increases with age. According
to “The Impact of Aging on Access to Technology” [30], cognitive functions pertaining to
memory, attention, and spatial cognition gradually decline with age. This is particularly the case
when confronted with unfamiliar situations, such as new technology. Declines in working
memory and attentional capacity make it difficult for senior citizens to learn new concepts and
skills, recall procedures, perform concurrent activities and switch attention between different
displays of information.
2.2.3

Other Barriers

Lack of experience with computers creates anxiety, lack of confidence, and negative
attitudes toward computers; however, effective learning and familiarity with technology
decreases anxiety and reluctance. Although older adults are reported to have significantly higher
computer anxiety than younger adults, surveys repeatedly suggest that training the elderly to use
computers reduces their levels of computer anxiety [11, 40]. In addition, computer use helps to

4

increase self-efficacy and lower computer anxiety thereby increasing overall life satisfaction
[34].
Senior citizens also tend to be concerned with personal and private information being
stolen over the Internet. They are afraid of damaging the computer and getting viruses and
worms. It is no surprise: according to a study at Kaspersky Lab, a leading computer security
company, the number of malicious programs has risen tremendously over the years. Figure 1
below, from a Kaspersky Security Bulletin in 2010, shows the jump in malware samples detected
over a 7 year period [44]. The jump that occurred between 2007 and 2008 can be attributed to the
spread of rootkits, malicious programs which target online games, and botnets [58].

Figure 1: Malware Samples Detected over a 7 Year Period
According to Kaspersky Lab research, the main focus of modern malware has been to
steal users’ accounts, regardless of whether they are of the banking, e-mail or social networking
variety. For 2011, they predict that a new class of spyware will emerge, stealing any and all
information including location, work, friends, income, eye color, hair color, etc. Inexperienced
and novice computer users will unknowingly click on advertisements and pop-ups, opening
malicious links and entering personal information. Some people are unaware of the dangers of

5

the Internet, though wary about entering personal information. Others simply do not have the
experience to tell an advertisement from an information source.

Table 1: Barriers to Computer Use by Older Adults
Numerous studies summarized in Table 1 from “Computer Use by Older Adults” have
looked at barriers to computer use by older adults [37]. One study on older adults’ use of
information and communications [33] suggested that the top 5 reasons for not using ICT
(information and communication technologies) are lack of interest/motivation (by 25% of
individuals who had not made use of a computer in the past 12 months), feeling too old (21%),
having no need (18%), no skills/inability to use computers (13%) and no access (7%). Small
percentages of people cited ill health, fear of computers being too technical, and cost as chief
reasons for not using ICT (2%, 2% and 1%, respectively).
Lack of interest and relevance to life as the chief reason for people not using computers
suggests that there might be a lack of overall awareness for the many potential benefits
computers can offer senior citizens. Similarly, Melenhorst, Rogers, and Bouwhuis (2006) assert
that it is a lack of perceived benefit, rather than cost issues, keeping older adults from seeking

6

out and using new technologies, either because their needs are not met by the technology or they
do not understand they ways in which they would benefit from the technology [37].

3 Senior Centered Design
3.1 What are the current solutions
There are various current solutions proposed for increasing web accessibility for senior
citizens. Several institutions such as the National Institute on Aging [8] and the National Library
on Medicine [10], as well as the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines created by the World
Wide Web Consortium [19], provide design guidelines to follow. The NIA published a checklist
called, “Making Your Website Senior Friendly” [8]. It consists of recommendations about visual
website components like typefaces, text sizes, physical spacing and justification, and
backgrounds and colors. They also discuss how to present information in terms of style,
phrasing, simplicity, and organization. There are media and layout guidelines, as well as other
information flow tips. In addition, several reports published by the Nielsen Norman Group
provide guidelines for design, including “Web Usability for Senior Citizens: 46 Design
Guidelines Based on Usability Studies with People Age 65 and Older” [16, 17]. The World Wide
Web Consortium, a leading international community that develops web standards, also has a
Web Accessibility Initiative that develops guidelines widely regarded as the international
standard for web accessibility, as well as support materials and other resources [19].
The United States Government has also taken a stance on accessibility, amending the
Rehabilitation Act of 1973 with Section 508 Laws in 1998. Section 508 requires that Federal
agencies make electronic and information technology accessible to people with disabilities. It
was enacted to eliminate barriers in IT, helping individuals with impairments obtain and use
information quickly and easily. The Federal Information Technology Accessibility Initiative

7

offers information and technical assistance on implementing Section 508, including a checklist
for ensuring accessibility when designing websites [18].
In addition, the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), in partnership
with the U.S. General Services Administration, came out with Research-Based Web Design &
Usability Guidelines [22]. This was originally created as part of the National Cancer Institute's
usability.gov project and at its start in March of 2000, consisted of over 500 guidelines, based on
the best available research, to help designers build Web sites. Since 2000, it has undergone
several transformations. A first internal review process narrowed down the very large list to a
more manageable list of 398 guidelines. A further look determining the “relative importance” of
each guideline narrowed it down to 287, and after several more cuts a final set of 187 guidelines
was published in 2004. This set was updated and edited, and the most recent 2006 version
consists of 209 carefully picked guidelines, each with a “strength of evidence” and “relative
importance” ranking from 1 to 5.
In addition to the numerous sources that publish usability standards guidelines, web
browsers and operating systems also have personalization tools for accessibility. As an example,
the Windows 7 operating system has an “Ease of Access” center within the control panel, where
it is possible to change and optimize visual display settings, text size, how the mouse and
keyboard work, and adjust audio devices replacing sounds with visual cues and using speech
recognition. There is the option to accommodate low vision and use a screen reader, change
contrast, specify single or double clicking to open folders, edit font settings, and more. Apple’s
OS X also has accessibility tools, with built-in screen reading, voice over technology, automatic
drivers for braille displays, screen magnification, and task automating.
Web browsers also have accessibility tools. The top three current web browsers, Mozilla
Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Google Chrome with 42.8%, 26.6% and 23.8% usage statistics

8

[24] (as of January 2011) respectively, all have special features for accessibility. Mozilla Firefox
released a Voluntary Product Accessibility Template in 2009 [27] citing accessibility
compliance. Firefox has numerous extensions and add-ons available. such as screen readers,
theme font size changers, page zoom buttons, mouse-less browsing, and many others [26].
Firefox has accessibility themes or ‘skins’ that change the appearance of Firefox to have high or
low contrast and extra large icons and buttons with large bold text, helpful for people with visual
impairments. Internet Explorer 8 has accessibility features, some of which include accelerators to
simplify common tasks, using the keyboard to select text and move around a webpage,
customizable font and colors, and zooming to enlarge everything on the page [28]. Google
Chrome also has over 5,000 accessibility extensions to choose from, focusing on helping people
with special needs, such as limited vision [29]. Chrome has features for zooming, web browsing
using the keyboard instead of the mouse, smooth mouse gestures, color control, and others.

3.2 Problems with current solutions
Although the Section 508 Laws require Federal agencies to make information technology
accessible for people with disabilities, numerous websites still do not implement the latest
recommendations. Too often, usability is not a major concern in web development and the proper
checks are not made to ensure a user friendly web site.
Browsers also have certain tools for accessibility, but they are often hard to find without
specific knowledge of them. Many people are unaware that these options exist, especially the
populations that would most benefit from them. These add-ons would all be quite difficult for a
novice user to install; many novice users do not know what downloading and uploading mean,
and are reluctant to even install safe software updates. Unless someone explicitly searches for
these options, it is difficult for a novice, senior citizen to be able to use a browser properly and
comfortably.

9

There are numerous shortcomings with all of the current solutions to the problem of
accessibility. The checklists available and all of the literature that has been written about good
usability practices, unfortunately do not get enough attention as many websites are not up to par
with standards, especially those created by individuals without the resources or time to devote to
good usability practices.

3.3 Skype
Skype, a popular video and voice call and chatting program, has the power to improve
senior citizens' quality of life by offering them the opportunity to talk with distant friends and
family. Currently, younger Internet users are significantly more likely to take part in video chats
or calls. Approximately 29% of the Internet users ages 18-29 have participated in video calls,
chats or teleconferences, compared with 15% of Internet users age 65 or older [49]. However,
according to MobiHealthNews.com and the New York Times, Skype is expanding into the
telehealth and assisted living facilities markets. Experts predict that services such as Skype will
become more heavily utilized as baby boomers age, due largely to advances in video
communication programs allowing for independent living and improved healthcare in remote
areas [45]. Skype allows elderly individuals to feel more included in their social circles,
particularly when they have issues with mobility.

3.4 Social Media
The impact of social media and social networks on older adults’ well-being has become
an increasing area of interest for gerontology research. Social media usage has grown
tremendously among Internet users ages 50 and older. Among users between the ages of 50 and
64, social media use rose from 22% in April 2009 to 42% in May 2010. Among users ages 65+,
usage of social media grew from 13% to 26% within that same time period [5, 39]. Although

10

younger generations are currently more likely to use social networking sites, the fastest growth
has come from Internet users 74 and older. Social network site usage for this demographic has
quadrupled since 2008, from 4% to 16% [50].
According to the Pew Research Center’s Internet & American Life Project’s new report,
“Older Adults and Social Media,” [5] between April 2009 and May 2010, Internet users between
the ages of 50-64 who said they use a social networking site increased 88%, from 25% to 47%,
and use among those ages 65 and older grew 100%, from 13% to 26%. The growth rate for those
ages 18-29 by comparison was only 13%, from 76% to 86%. One of the reasons for this rapid
rise, according to Mary Madden, Pew senior research specialist and author of the report, is that
senior citizens are aware that their children and grandchildren are spending time on Facebook
and Twitter, and want to keep up with them to bridge generational gaps, so to speak. Mary
Madden added, “There are few other spaces — online or offline — where tweens, teens,
sandwich generation members, grandparents, friends and neighbors regularly intersect and
communicate across the same network.”
Studies have suggested that active participation in seniors’ online communities may
contribute to the well-being of older adults. As noted in a 2009 study on seniors in online
communities, Social support affects Psychological Well-Being (PWB) by doing the following:
helping people cope with difficult life events, strengthening personal control and feelings of selfworth, encouraging hope and optimism, and enhancing mental stimulation and active social
engagement [33]. The above study looked at 14 established online communities for senior
citizens over a year long period. It found that the top 6 subjects discussed were the following:
1. Fun on line – Over 140,000 posts including funny stories and jokes that people share
with each other, as well as online games, riddles, etc.
2. Retirement- Over 94,000 posts including discussions of retirement rights, pensions,
relocation, etc.

11

3. Family- Over 77,000 posts concerning spousal relationships, parenthood, and
grandparenting.
4. Health- Over 56,000 posts dealing with both sickness (e.g., medical conditions,
medicines) and wellness (e.g., nutrition, beauty).
5. Work and Study- Over 50,000 posts that relate to possible occupations for retirees,
including jobs and courses
6. Recreation- Over 48,000 posts including recommendations of books, films, etc.
The researchers came to several valuable conclusions about the benefits of these online
communities for senior citizens. The nature of the popular discussion subjects, namely
retirement, family, and health, suggest that when facing transitions that occur later in life like
retirement, loss, and declining health, senior citizens “find comfort in sharing their emotions
online with peers, who may have been through similar experiences and can provide
understanding and good advice. In addition, the dominance of ‘Fun on line’ suggests that these
communities also offer relief and distraction from stressful circumstances. When feeling bored,
sad, or lonely, one can avoid these feelings by chatting and playing with other online friends.”
Table 2 from “Computer Use by Older Adults” [37], and Figure 2 from “Generations Online
2010: Summary” [50] summarize the most common computer uses of older adults;
communication tools, such as e-mail, are the most widely utilized of computer functions.

3.5 E-mail
In a study called, “Usable Computers for the Elderly: Applying Coaching Experiences,”
[46] authors Kantner & Rosenbaum observe that the primary reasons why senior citizens started
to learn how to use computers were e-mail and children. Seniors often bought their computers
because they wanted to communicate with their friends and children; they saw e-mail as a fast,
cost-effective way to achieve this and felt that they were ‘missing something’ without it.
Additionally, children often purchased computers for their parents because they wanted e-mail
contact with them and felt it was ‘time to learn.’
According to Pew Internet and American Life Project data from April, 2009, 90% of US
Internet users have gone online and sent or read e-mail. Each day, an incredible 247 billion emails are sent and the number of e-mail users (1.4 billion in 2009) is expected to rise to 1.9
billion by 2013 [3]. Senior citizens are also utilizing the benefits of e-mail; 92% of those ages 50
to 64, and 89% of those ages 65 and older say they send or read e-mail, and more than half of
each age group e-mails on a typical day [39].

3.6 A Software Solution – BigScreenLive, Eldy and PointerWare
BigScreenLive[53], Eldy[51], and PointerWare[52] are software application solutions to
the problem of accessibility for senior citizens. Each of these software programs has its own email address the user sets up with installation of the program. They have simple built in e-mail
applications, easy interfaces specifically tailored to senior citizens, compatibility with touch
screen computers, and support. BigScreenLive and PointerWare have a one-month free trial
followed by the option to purchase (annual membership costs $119.40 for BigScreenLive, and
PointerWare has a one-time fee of $149), and Eldy is free software. These programs also have
some built in security features to protect people from malicious attacks. PointerWare runs on top
of other windows, so any pop-ups, automatic updates, update downloads and virus updates are

14

hidden from the user to avoid causing confusion. PointerWare also filters e-mail using
SpamAssasin. The BigScreenLive system checks all incoming e-mail to make sure it is free of
viruses, providing their own internet browsing security, spam filter, and pop-up blocking. Eldy
also has spam protection, with pop-up blocking as well. Although they all aim to help senior
citizens utilize the Internet in a user friendly way, and each includes its own e-mail and web
browsing components, these programs differ in some of the other features and components they
include, as well as layout, navigation and functionality.
3.6.1

BigScreenLive

BigScreenLive has a home page with 7 large colorful buttons on the left hand side of the
screen (Mail, Photos, DailyDigest, Web, Shop, Games, Tools) and a photo of the day, quote of
the day, and weather report on the main part or center of the screen (see Figure 3).
The e-mail system has 5 tabs on top, much like file folder tabs, saying InBox, Write Mail,
Address Book, Mail Sent, and Trash from left to right (see Figure 4). The InBox is where new
mail arrives and old mail is stored; users have the option to reply, forward, and delete e-mails.
The write mail tab shows a blank e-mail for the user to fill in and send, with a simple “to” line, a
subject, and a body of the letter. The address book allows users to save information for their
contacts. The mail sent tab shows all e-mails that have already been sent, and the trash shows
deleted e-mails. Viruses and spam are automatically blocked by BigScreenLive to keep them
from getting to the user. BigScreenLive protects users from unsolicited e-mail, viruses, phishing,
and pop-up advertisements [53].
BigScreenLive has a photo sharing category (see Figure 5) where users can keep digital
photos in albums, play them in a slideshow, print them, and send them to friends and family by
e-mail. There is the option to keep albums private or share them with friends and family. There is

15

also a portal online where friends and family can sign on to upload pictures and share on the
friends and family portal.
The Daily Digest category lets users see the top news stories from Yahoo! News. There
are 5 tabs with news, money, health, sports and entertainment information. Web Browsing (see
Figure 7) is another category, with three tabs for the users’ favorites, ‘family favorites’, and ‘our
favorites,’ i.e. suggested favorites by the creators of the program. There is one search bar where
URL’s can be entered as well as search terms. Google is the default search engine. There is also a
button at the bottom of the screen to add bookmarks that get saved in ‘my favorites’.

There is also an online shopping category, powered by Amazon.com, a games category
with 11 available games to play, and a tools category for managing user information. In addition,
there are several great features. At the bottom of the screen, there are buttons for enlarging the
text and for minimizing the text, a help button, and a print button for easy access printing.

Eldy

The Eldy association is a non-profit organization designed in 2005 in Italy and introduced
in Mexico, France, the Netherlands, Germany, and the UK. The Eldy software program has
already been translated into 22 languages. It currently has approximately 220,000 users. Eldy’s
home page (see Figure 8) is called ‘The Square.’ There are six buttons on the home screen: mail,
surf the web, my profile, chat, Eldy TV, and useful tools. The e-mail category takes the user to a
screen with 3 options, mail, write, and address book. If a user goes to mail, they will have three
more options: new mail, mail read, and mail sent. The ‘surf the web’ button on the home screen,
or ‘square,’ takes the user to an Internet browsing page where there are pre-set websites (see
Figure 9) on what they call the ‘Portal’, as well as a place for bookmarks and a text field for
URL’s. ‘My Profile’ contains general information about the user, and the chat category (see

17

Figure 10) allows the user to chat with friends, relatives and other people online using Eldy from
around the world.
Eldy also has a category called ‘Eldy TV’ (see Figure 12) that shows a list of popular
websites where users can watch different videos. Hulu is featured, as well as CNN.com,
YouTube and TED. Lastly, a useful tools category (see Figure 11) has three options: ‘skype’- a
video chatting program, ‘notepad’- a text editor, and ‘documents’- for picture management.

PointerWare

PointerWare, deployed in 2008, is currently available in beta format in English, French,
Spanish, Japanese, Mandarin and Cantonese. It has a home screen (see Figure 13) consisting of 6
large icons, namely ‘Internet’, ‘photos’, ‘mail’, ‘phone’, ‘games’, and ‘exit’. The mail option
takes the user to a screen with three buttons, one to read mail, one to write mail, and one to find
mail (see Figure 14). When the user opens the e-mail, (see Figure 15) they can delete it, forward
it, print it, reply to it, have the program read the e-mail out loud, and go to the next e-mail or next
page of the e-mail. The Internet button from the home screen will take the user to a screen for
web browsing (see Figure 16), with a simple instruction to type what you are searching for, and
click ‘Search Now!’. Underneath the searching textbox, saved web pages are listed. When a user
accesses a web page, they can save it, increase or decrease text size with two large magnifying
glass symbol buttons, as well as print and go back. There is also a button for scrolling down (see
Figure 17). The phone button from the home screen links up to Skype, (see Figure 18) and
automatically imports online contacts into the “Whom do you want to call?” window. The user
must be signed into Skype in the background of the program in order to use this feature. The
photos button automatically saves photos that have been received in e-mails. There is also a

19

games category (see Figure 19) where the user is presented with card games, board games, trivia
quiz, word games and web games. Some of the games link up to existing games on Yahoo!
Games, while others are built into the PointerWare package.

3.7 Research on BigScreenLive, Eldy and PointerWare
Although a lot of research has been done on aging and technology, there has been little
research analyzing the use of programs such as BigScreenLive, Eldy, and PointerWare outside of
internal company research done to improve these products.
A study on the usability of Eldy was made by the Faculty of Psychology, University of

21

Padua, Center for Cognitive Science by analyzing the eye movements of a sample of elderly
Eldy users. The observations, mouse logging and a cognitive walkthrough study showed that
Eldy is generally easy to use, with some exceptions, and the difficulties encountered by the
elderly are due to non-recognition of some commands or icons as opposed to an inadequate
understanding of the text and images. Difficulties are more often attributed to unfamiliarity with
some specific procedures that are generally used in interaction interface [43].
In a study titled “Senior-Friendly Computer Interface to Enhance Learning and
Independent Use of Email Among Seniors” [38] that trained 25 elderly people to login, read and
write e-mail on Windows Live Hotmail and PointerWare, gathering task performance time,
number of ‘errors’ and a subjective confidence score, users performed all training and tasks
significantly faster using PointerWare compared to Windows Live Hotmail. They were also
more confident using PointerWare and made 84% fewer errors.
Some of the research that mentions these programs includes a 2009 Market Overview
called “Technology for Aging in Place” [31]. This overview revealed that seniors and caregivers
are interested in the technological advances that exist, but are not necessarily aware of what
exists. Nearly half of 50-64 year-olds have broadband connections and only 7% of caregivers
currently use a computer to stay in touch with the person that they help. Approximately 90% of
caregivers believe they would have difficulty persuading the person they help use a personal
computer to stay in touch. The overview lists four “Aging in Place” technology categories; Email, Social Networking, and Education and Learning fall into the Communication and
Engagement, and Learning and Contribution categories. PointerWare and BigScreenLive are
briefly mentioned as “simplification products” that mask the complexity of PC applications.
“The PC – and its unfettered wired and wireless access to the Internet -- offers by far the
broadest access to technologies to help seniors remain in their homes.”

22

This research aims to compare and examine the usability of the three software programs
for senior citizens, as well as the usability of a touch screen interface. A think-aloud usability
study was supplemented by surveys, examining the combined use of touch-screen interfaces and
accessibility-enhanced software. The goal was to ascertain how useful senior citizens find
certain design decisions and how to improve the user experience.

4 Methods
The study was performed one-on-one; each participant would come for one hour to work
on an HP TouchSmart 300 computer that was provided, and they would complete an initial
survey, several tasks on the computer, and a concluding survey.

4.1 Recruitment
In order to get a good representative spread of people in different capacity/skill levels
(e.g., no prior computer use, novice with some use, some skill with more previous use), 32
participants aged 55+ were recruited using fliers, word of mouth, and phone calls. The majority
of participants came from independent living communities. The major benefit of using real
potential users as opposed to experts is that regardless of the skill and experience of an expert
usability specialist, they are still evaluators who emulate the user community and are not typical
users of the web site. Real users on the other hand often have unexpected and surprising
problems, and sometimes have no problems where we expect them to have the most. By
studying actual users and the key audience group, senior citizens, I sought to discover which
problems users will encounter most frequently [15].

4.2 Quantitative and Qualitative Data
My approach was to obtain both quantitative and qualitative data for the most in-depth
analysis. The pre and post-surveys contained rating scales designed to capture estimates of

23

magnitude, as well as several open-ended questions where users could describe their feelings,
experiences and opinions (see Section 8.2). Likert scale ratings were used to get a quantitative
subjective measurement for satisfaction, and their comments related to satisfaction for more in
depth, qualitative information. A screen, audio and video logging software called Camtasia [55]
was utilized to log the sessions. A web camera was set up over the computer or in some cases to
the side of the computer (depending on the lab area) pointed at the computer screen, to
distinguish screen touches from mouse clicks, because the Camtasia software currently cannot do
this. Videos of each session were manually viewed and analyzed to evaluate performance based
on performance metrics, also obtaining additional quantitative data such as task success, errors
and efficiency, as well as qualitative subjective data like the participant's comments related to
completing the tasks.

4.3 Data Collection
4.3.1

Surveys

Two surveys were designed, a pre-survey that participants would complete before doing
the computer tasks, and a post-survey they would complete afterward. Participants would have
15 minutes to fill each survey. The subjective, self-reported preference data give the most
important information about participants’ perception of the system and their interaction with it.
Often times, even if a user was frustrated with a certain subtask, they were still overall very
satisfied with the program.
4.3.1.1 Pre-Survey

The pre-survey starts with some basic demographic information, such as age, gender,
education and employment. All of the participants were 55+ as per study requirements and they
all happened to be retired as well. Next, basic health information was asked pertaining to

24

limitations with hand mobility, eye sight, hearing and memory. Participants were asked to gauge
their current comfort with computers on a 7-point Likert scale, and were asked some technical
information to see how they learned to use computers (if they had ever used a computer before),
how often they used computers, what kinds of tasks they have used computers for, and what their
interaction preference is (mouse, touchpad on a laptop, or touch screen). None of the participants
had ever used a touch screen before. In order to gauge whether or not the e-mail and web
browsing components of the software they used were easier to use than previous experience, I
asked them to measure their previous ease-of-use of e-mail and web browsing. Next on the
survey were 14 questions that I grouped into 3 categories: comfort/discomfort, interest in
computers, and confidence. The last two questions on the survey were open-ended, and asked
those who have used a computer before what they have found to be most frustrating or confusing
about using a computer, and those who are not regular computer users what has kept them from
using a computer.
4.3.1.2 Post-Survey
In deciding the best questions to ask to obtain the most useful results, I looked to a study
in 2004 titled “A Comparison of Questionnaires for Assessing Website Usability,” that looked at
the effectiveness of various questionnaires for assessing the perceived usability of an interactive
system. The study concluded that one of the simplest questionnaires studied, the System
Usability Scale (SUS), with only 10 rating scales, yielded some of the most reliable results
across sample sizes. It is also the only questionnaire of those studied whose questions address
different aspects of the user’s response to the website as a whole (e.g., “I found the website
unnecessarily complex”, “I felt very confident using the website”) as opposed to asking the user
to evaluate specific features of the website (e.g., visual appearance, organization of information,
etc) [25].

25

I used the System Usability Scale (SUS) as a tool for gaining insights to user satisfaction.
The SUS, developed by John Brooke at Digital Equipment Co Ltd., Reading, United Kingdom,
is a ten statement questionnaire whose responses indicate the degree of agreement or
disagreement on a 7-point Likert scale.
I also included questions from the Computer Attitude Scale (CAS) and Computer
Anxiety Rating Scale (CARS)[16]. It has been found that many older adults tend to
underestimate their actual computer knowledge and under-confidence in their abilities may pose
a major hindrance for older adults to master computer technology [34]. This is one of the many
reasons it is important to look at computer confidence and anxiety. The Computer Attitude Scale
and its three subscales (Computer Liking, Computer Confidence, and Computer Anxiety) is an
effective, reliable, and convenient instrument to measure attitudes towards learning about and
using computers [12,41].
4.3.2

Study Tasks

Each user was given two tasks to complete using one of the three interfaces, involving
using e-mail and searching on the Internet for information. Both had subtasks, and participants
were given 15 minutes to do each task. In order to keep the order of the tasks from impacting the
results, counterbalancing was used to randomize the order that participants would do the tasks.
Some participants started with the e-mail task, and others with the web browsing task. In order to
pick the tasks, I looked at what kinds of activities senior citizens tend to do most using the
Internet, to give them tasks that they would be most likely to do on their own if they were to use
a computer. It has been found that senior citizens tend to use computers and the Internet for the
same activities that younger users are known to, but perform different activities to different
extents. Table 2 and Figure 2 in Section 3.4 summarize the most common computer uses of older
adults.

26

Since the tasks were slightly different for the three programs, meaning, there were certain
different steps to take to get the same result, I chunked some of the small subtasks or steps to
keep consistency amongst the programs. I chunked the subtasks the following way for the e-mail
task:
1. Go to your e-mail
2. Add address to address book
3. Write and send e-mail
4. Go to read new mail
5. Print e-mail
6. Delete e-mail
For the web browsing task, I chunked the subtasks into the following:
1. Go to the web to browse for a recipe
2. Search for a lasagna recipe
3. Increase text size
4. Add bookmark
5. Locate saved bookmark
4.3.3

Measuring Usability

There are many different ways to go about defining usability. In 1998, the International
Standards Organization (ISO 9241-11) defined usability as the “Extent to which a product can be
used by specified users to achieve specified goals with effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction
in a specified context of use” [20]. Jakob Nielsen, a leading web usability consultant and
inventor of heuristic evaluation among other usability methods, writes in his 1993 book Usability
Engineering [54], “It is important to realize that usability is not a single, one-dimensional
property of a user interface. Usability has multiple components and is traditionally associated
with these five usability attributes: learnability, efficiency, memorability, errors, satisfaction.”
He goes on to further define those attributes [21]:

27

1. Learnability: How easy is it for users to accomplish basic tasks the first time they
encounter the design?
2. Efficiency: Once users have learned the design, how quickly can they perform tasks?
3. Memorability: When users return to the design after a period of not using it, how
easily can they reestablish proficiency?
4. Errors: How many errors do users make, how severe are these errors, and how easily
can they recover from the errors?
5. Satisfaction: How pleasant is it to use the design?
Human Computer Interaction and Web Usability expert Steve Krug, in his 2005 book,
Don’t Make Me Think, writes “After all, usability really just means making sure that something
works well: that a person of average (or even below average) ability and experience can use the
thing - whether it's a web site, a fighter jet, or a revolving door - for its intended purpose without
getting hopelessly frustrated” [17].
4.3.4

Usability Data Collection

In line with standard definitions of usability, data was grouped into three categories:
effectiveness, efficiency, and satisfaction. I defined effectiveness as the tasks completed
successfully and number of errors made by a user during task performance. Participants’
comments and opinions of how they felt completing a task were also taken into account. To
measure efficiency, the number of mouse clicks performed during task completion was counted.
Satisfaction was measured with Likert scale ratings. Though measurements of time were taken,
these measurements are slightly less reliable due to the impact that the think-aloud protocol has
on the time required to complete a task. Camtasia [55] was utilized to log the sessions, and
Microsoft Excel was used to store and analyze the results of the two surveys.

28
4.3.5

Think-Aloud Protocol

The Think-Aloud technique is intended to capture what participants are thinking while
they perform tasks [57]. Participants are encouraged to speak aloud their thought process and
commentary, any confusion they might have, frustration, as well as note things they like. The
technique allows the researcher to capture preference and performance information at the same
time. The researcher also gets clues about why people make certain actions and what their
expectations are, helping to trace why potential errors occur. Sometimes thinking aloud helps
participants focus on their task, and concentrate. However, some people find speaking aloud an
unnecessary distraction, and find it very unnatural. These participants have to be encouraged to
speak aloud, disrupting their rhythm. Thinking aloud also slows the thought process, making
people more careful and possibly preventing errors that might have occurred otherwise [47]. For
my purposes, the think-aloud technique worked fairly well. Some participants were reluctant to
think aloud, but valuable information was gleaned from their vocalization of thought processes.
When participants would forget to speak aloud or pause for a period of time, I kept a
technique sheet and used several techniques listed in the “Methods for successful Thinking Out
Loud Procedures” guide by Xerox Corporation [23] as well as Rubin and Chisnell’s “Handbook
of Usability Testing” [47] to keep them vocalizing. I would prompt, echo, use ‘conversational
disequilibrium’ and summarize at key points. Some neutral questions I would ask include:
1. What is your goal?
2. What did you expect when you did that?
3. What are you thinking right now?
4. You seem surprised/puzzled/frustrated, what happened?
5. What were you thinking when you used that feature?
6. Describe the steps you are going through here.
7. What did you expect to happen when you . . . .?

29

I would also echo their last words to see if they could elaborate on their thinking, and ask trailing
questions such as “And you were expecting. . .?”, “And your goal is . . .?” encouraging to
complete the thought. Often times, lack of confidence would keep participants from interacting
at all with the program, and after they completed a task they would ask ‘What do I do next?’ This
is when the summarizing technique was used, quickly reiterating what they just did while
encouraging them. Often, a little bit of encouragement would go a long way and give them that
little bit of confidence they would need to continue on their own.
When participants would get stuck or frustrated, and were unable to continue without my
intervention, I would gradually reveal hints to get them past an obstacle rather than revealing the
answer all at once. This way, I could see if it was minor intervention that was needed, moderate
intervention, or mark that they were unable to complete the task. I could distinguish the
minimum amount of information required for them to recover from the error. Often the
participant just needed to be guided to look all over the screen because they would get stuck
looking at one thing, or instruct them to read a direction on the page to see if it is helpful.
4.3.6

Analysis

Using video records, several performance metrics were used for evaluation. When going
through each session, the number of mouse clicks needed for a user to accomplish each task was
logged, whether or not the task was completed successfully and how much interference there
was, as well as how long it took to accomplish each task. Some of these metrics, such as mouse
clicks and time spent per completed task, were used to objectively measure efficiency, or amount
of effort. Camtasia logged mouse clicks that were manually counted. Double clicks or erroneous
clicks (such as when a user would touch the screen and it wouldn’t recognize the press) were not
counted. Only successful tasks were counted in the evaluation of efficiency; the mouse click
count for tasks users were unable to complete was not included. I used a count of tasks

30

completed successfully and a count of errors committed by the user during task performance to
measure effectiveness. Errors were logged, defined as the steps they took that did not get them
closer to their goal.
Since think-aloud protocol was used, time-on-task results were variable. Speaking aloud
almost always has an impact on time-on-task data [42], so it was only used as a general
measurement. There were some steps such as ‘locate the print button’ that I could get good time
measurements for, because participants were not saying anything out loud; they were just
looking for something and I would get a good estimate for how long it took them to find what
they were looking for.
4.3.7

Evaluation

In addition to the analysis performed on the three software programs, Eldy, PointerWare
and BigScreenLive, popular heuristics were kept in mind for evaluation to supplement the
information retrieved from the 32 participants and the results of the usability study. Heuristics
are recognized usability principles; interfaces are examined with respect to these principles to
help identify usability issues.
Jakob Nielsen and Rolf Molich's ten general principles for user interface design are listed
below, and were kept in mind during evaluation. [13, 14]

1. Visibility of System Status: It is essential that the user is always aware of where they are
and where they can go next.
2. Match Between the System and the Real World: The language used throughout the
interface needs to be appropriate for the user population. Words, phrases and concepts
need to be familiar to the user, and information flow should be in natural and logical
order.
3. User Control and Freedom: When users mistakenly find themselves somewhere they
did not mean to be, there should be a way for them to return or exit and be able to control

31

the system. For instance, an “exit” button that appears on every page lets a user know that
they can exit the program at any time.
4. Consistency and Standards: Throughout the program there should be consistency of
language, situations and actions. Users should not be burdened with ambiguity.
5. Error Prevention: The best way to prevent error is to do a lot of testing. However, when
errors occur, there should be user friendly messages in natural language as opposed to
code.
6. Recognition Rather than Recall: Objects, actions and options should be visible. This is
particularly important for the senior citizen population and novice computer users. Users
should not have to remember information between different parts of their interaction with
the program. Instructions should be clear and obtainable so users do not get lost and do
not have to retrace their steps from the home page. There should be a 'breadcrumb trail' or
some way for users to know what section they are on and how to reach other sections.
7. Flexibility and Efficiency of Use: Software should be well designed and developed. It
should be efficient and easy to use. The user should always feel that the software meets
expectations to perform the intended services.
8. Aesthetic and Minimalist Design: The system should not be cluttered with extraneous
information; this is distracting and slows down the user.
9. Help Users Recognize, Diagnose, and Recover from Errors: Errors are bound to
happen even with the most foolproof system. Error messages should be informative so
people can recover from them with minimal effort.
10. Help and Documentation: There should be an accessible way to locate help or
assistance with the system. The documentation should be easy to search, should focus on
the user's task, list concrete steps and not be overly complicated.

5 Survey Results
This section describes results obtained from the pre and post-surveys. Participants were
volunteers, so they had a generally positive attitude about learning how to use computers.

5.1 Demographics
For this study, 32 participants aged 55+ were recruited. According to Jakob Nielsen’s
“Why You Only Need to Test with 5 Users” [56], testing a single user catches almost a third of

32

all usability problems found. A second user will add some more insight and catch more
problems, but there will be some overlap of what is learned from their results with the first user.
By the third participant, almost 75% of usability problems are obtained. Nielsen suggests that
after the fifth user, one observes the same findings repeatedly and is not gaining much new
information. Having 10-11 participants using each program, according to Nielsen, should yield
the majority of usability problems.
An effort was made to try to keep the members of the three groups well dispersed by skill
level and to get a representative range of senior citizens using each program. Responses to the
question asking how often they currently use a computer were used to determine which program
they would use. Figures 20 - 23 (see Section 8.3) represent demographic information. The
participants ranged in age from 62 – 90 years old. The majority of participants (78%) were
female, and had a high school or college degree. Figure 22 in Section 8.3, “How often
participants use computer,” shows that the number of participants using each program was
balanced by skill level.

5.2 Previous experience with computers
To learn about the previous experiences participants had with computers, the survey asked
what tasks they had previously done on a computer and how they were taught to use a computer
(if applicable). Participants were able to check more than one answer for those questions, as
reflected in the figures below.
Approximately 44% of participants learned to use a computer from family or friends.
Close to a third (34%) cited self-taught as their main method of learning, and less than 10%
learned in the work place. The most common tasks done previously on a computer included
using e-mail (81%) and searching for information (75%). The least commonly done task was
web/video chatting of which 5 participants, or 16% of the population, had previously tried.

5.3 Physical and Cognitive Limitations
It is important from a design perspective to have a good iidea
dea of the most common physical
and cognitive limitations senior citizens face. By far, the most common physical limitation in this
survey was difficulty with vision, which 84% of participants had (see Figure 226 below). About

34

half of all participants (53%) faced some sort of trouble with memory, of which 59% had
minimal problems and 41% noted
oted moderate problems. Difficulties with hearing and hands were
less common though still significant (31% of the population had difficulties with hands and 34%
suffered difficulty
fficulty with hearing).

5.4 Preferences for Interaction
Figure 27 below shows participants’ preferences for interaction before and after the study.
None of the participants had ever used a touch screen computer before the study, and 89% of
respondents listed the mouse and keyboard as their preferred way of interacting with
w the
computer; 11% of respondents listed touch pad (on a laptop) as their preference.
After the study, there was a large shift away from the mouse and keyboard, with the
majority of respondents (56%) now listing a combination of mouse and touch screen as their
preferred way to interact with the computer. After completing the study,, 22% of participants
preferred mouse and keyboard exclusively, and 22% of participants preferred the touch screen

35

exclusively. This shift suggests that while some users prefer to stick with what they know and
are used to, many individuals, with and without hand limitations, find the touch screen interface
useful. Of the participants who noted difficulties with hands (difficulty moving fingers,
numbness, tremor, pain), 40% prefe
preferred
rred using a combination of touch screen and
mouse/keyboard, 40% preferred using the touch screen exclusively, and 20% preferred using the
mouse and keyboard. This suggests that for senior citizens who have difficulties with hands, the
touch screen may be very beneficial.

5.5 User Satisfaction
One of the best ways to gauge how users re
responded
sponded to the different programs was to
evaluate user satisfaction. Users self
self-reported this information in the post-survey.
survey. What is
interesting
teresting in Figure 28 below, “Satisfaction,” is that users had the least satisfaction with Eldy’s
system of navigation. Results off a one
one-way ANOVA comparing user satisfaction with navigation

36

across the programs show significant difference (F (2, 29) = 5.98, p = .0066). Overall design
followed the same pattern, with BigScreenLive users most satisfied. However, Eldy users were
more likely by a small margin to seek a computer in the future, which may possibly be attributed
to the types of people using the programs and their personal interest in pursuing use of a
computer again. Even though Eldy users might be more likely to seek a computer in the future,
Eldy users were less likely than BigScreenLive users to use the program again (see Figure 29
below, “Likeliness to Repeat Tasks”). Results of a one-way ANOVA comparing likeliness to use
the program again show significant difference (F (2, 29) = 5.04, p = .0131). Interestingly,
PointerWare users had the lowest likelihood of using the program again, while their overall
experience was still positive and they were generally pleased with the overall design, ranking it a
6.36 out of a possible 7 (very satisfied).
The navigation of the Eldy program differs from PointerWare and BigScreenLive. It seems
one of the reasons for the difficulties users experience is because they might not have a good
sense of what ‘home’ is and how to get there. “Stable visual elements not only enable people to
navigate fast, they act as dependable landmarks, giving people a sense of ‘home’” [48]. There
should always be some way for users to know what section they are on and how to reach other
sections. The main screen of the PointerWare program has “Home” written across it, with a
recognizable ‘Home’ button (with the PointerWare logo- a dog) on every page, so once a user
clicks on ‘Mail’ or ‘Internet’, there is consistency and they can find the ‘Home’ button in the top
left-hand corner.
The BigScreenLive interface does not say “Home” anywhere on the main home page;
however, there is a button in the bottom left corner that never goes away with a picture of a
house. If the user puts the cursor over the button, a mouse-over textbox appears saying “Go to
BigScreenLive Home”.

37

Eldy’s home page differs
rs in that there is less consistency (see Figure 34 where Eldy users
ranked the program with highest inconsistency). Eldy’s home page is called “The Square” and
when a user is viewing the home page, the words “The Square” can be found at the top of the
screen.
een. When a user navigates away to any other page, there is a button at the bottom of the page
in the center that changes text depending on where in the site a user may be. For instance, if a
user is one step from the square, it will say “Back to the Squar
Square.”
e.” If a user is reading an e-mail,
e
the button at the bottom will say “Back to mail menu.” People often would not recognize the
heading of the page, or the text at the top of the page, (i.e. “Mail”, “Internet”, “The Square”) as
the heading and thought it might
ight take them somewhere, clicking on it with no result. In addition,
if a user was in the e-mail
mail part of the program and wanted to go to the Internet, they would look
around the page, see “Back to mail menu,” and say out loud that they did not know where to go
because they did not want to go back to the mail menu, not realizing that they would have to go
back several times to get to the home screen.

5.6 Task evaluation and confidence
Another part of user satisfaction is a measurement of task evaluation before and after the
study. I wanted to see if users with prior eexperience with search or e-mail found those tasks to be
easier or more difficult after using their respective program. Figure 331, “Task Evaluation,”
Evaluation shows
on a Likert scale from 1 to 7 where 1 is very difficult and 7 is very easy, how people who have
previously performed the tasks ranked them before and after the study. What is apparent from
this graph is that most participants felt the ta
tasks
sks were easier to accomplish after using the
programs, with the exception of only one task
task, using e-mail,
mail, with the Eldy program. Shown in
Table 4 below, the greatest change observed occurred with the web browsing
ing task in
PointerWare. The next biggest incr
increase in ease was also with the web browsing
ing task, using the
BigScreenLive program.

The biggest difference between Eldy’s ee-mail
mail program and that of PointerWare and
BigScreenLive is the flow of steps. Despite the fact that Eldy and PointerWare users encounter a
minimum of 10 screens to complete the task, and BigScreenLive users encounter 8, it
i took
participants over 2 minutes to write and send an ee-mail
mail in Eldy, and under 1 minute to do the
th
same task using PointerWare (Figure
Figure 336). Even though the number of screens participants see to
complete the task is the same, as shown in Figure 30 below, it takes Eldy users on average 12.92
more clicks to complete the
he task than PointerWare users (F (2, 22) = 27.88, p = 9.29 x 10-07).
Figures 38, 39 and 40 in Section 8.3 show flow diagrams of steps to get through writing and
sending an e-mail
mail (including adding the new contact to the address book).

In Eldy, the user adds an address to the address book, goes to write an e-mail, and then gets
to a page where they have the option to send the e-mail, attach documents and pictures, and
choose addressees. Participants got confused at this step, and most clicked “Send” as opposed to
“Choose the addressees.” Some did not know where their e-mail went, since it does not appear
with the sending options page; they thought it disappeared and would click ‘Back’.
In PointerWare, when a user clicks ‘Write e-mail’, they have to pick a recipient or add a
new contact, and then they are explicitly asked if they would like to send an e-mail to the contact
they just added. This step eliminates any other need for the user to specify who they are writing
to. There is also a confirmation step after they click “Send,” to make sure they know who the email is being sent to.
BigScreenLive’s flow is a little different as well, as the user adds the e-mail address to the
address book and then goes to the “Write mail” tab. Adding a contact to the address book caused
some people confusion. This occurred because the address book window popped-up covering the
screen, and the participant read the directions in the address book window, as well as the
directions on the screen behind the address book, getting confused about which instructions to
follow. When writing an e-mail, there is a text box with a blue “To” button next to it, and an
instruction that tells users that they can click the “To” button to choose whom they want to write
to. Most participants did not read this instruction and just started typing in the text box. There
was minor confusion at this step when the blue drop down box appeared, as experienced users
knew that a contact name “Bella” was not equivalent to an e-mail address, and didn’t quite
understand how you can send an e-mail to someone’s name and not have to put their address in.
Either way, the name of the contact and the e-mail message are displayed on the same page, so
the user knows who the e-mail is going to. One participant said about Eldy, “I’d like everything

41

to be on the same page so you can just find it all, instead of going back and forth. To me that’s a
little easier, but this is better to see.”

Computer Attitude Scale, Computer Anxiety Rating Scale, and System
Usability Scale results
The same 14 questions gathered from the Computer Attitude Scale and the Computer

Anxiety Rating Scale were included in both the pre-survey and the post-survey to see how
comfortable or anxious people felt before and after using the programs, as well as how useful
they found computers. The purpose of this was to see was if certain programs made participants
feel more confident and at ease than others. Figure 34 shows the most interesting subset of my
results. Figure 35 in the appendix contains the full graph of results.

42

Concerning user confidence, PointerWare had the highest before and after study change
of the three programs, suggesting people became the most confident upon using the program. A
pattern emerged that positive questions get higher values of agreement and negative questions
get lower values of disagreement. The System Usability Scale results below display the pattern
above where participants agree more with positive statements and disagree more with negative
statements, suggesting that overall participants had a positive attitude about the programs.
The System Usability Scale also shows that participants had more struggles with Eldy
than other programs. Eldy participants agreed the most that they had to learn a lot of things to get
going with the program. They found the program the most cumbersome to use (F (2, 29) = 2.78,
p = .0782), and found the program unnecessarily complex (F (2, 29) = 3.16, p = .0569).
PointerWare generally came out in the middle for most of the questions, with the
exception of “I think I would need the support of a technical person to be able to use this
program” where participants agreed more than disagreed with the statement, and “I think that I
would like to use this program frequently.” PointerWare users also felt that they did not need to
learn a lot of things to get going with the program. BigScreenLive came out on top for most of
the questions. In the questions “I think using a computer would be very hard for me” and
“Computers intimidate me because they seem so complex”, BigScreenLive had the biggest
change (in the negative direction) citing people disagreed more with the statements and felt
overall less intimidated by computers after using the program.

6 Task Completion Results
As a whole, participants were able to complete the majority of tasks they were given.
However, there were some tasks that were clearly more difficult than others, and some design
decisions made across the programs that impacted the users in positive and negative ways. This

44

section explores difficulties for participants in completing the tasks, with recommendations for
improvement in the following section.

6.1 Timing
The following chart is a summary of timing results. Participants were able to complete all of
the tasks the fastest using the PointerWare program. Looking at the time on task table below,
participants completed tasks using PointerWare faster than with both other programs. However,
this is not the case with all of the subtasks and steps.

Table 7: Time on Task
Figure 36, “Average Time on Task,” is a more detailed look at how long it took
participants to complete each subtask within the e-mail and web browsing tasks. This shows
where the biggest hurdles were. A few subtasks will be focused on here, namely writing and
sending an e-mail, reading a new e-mail, printing an e-mail, deleting an e-mail, adding a
bookmark and finding a saved bookmark. These are the tasks that had the greatest levels of
variance.
To further determine why there was such variance within some of the e-mail tasks, flow
diagrams were created to document how many steps it would take someone to complete one of
the tasks that had multiple steps, namely the writing and sending an e-mail task (see Figures 38,
39 and 40). Due to the natural variance in the structure of the e-mail systems, there were some
programs where it had to take longer to complete the task than other programs. For instance,
PointerWare had the fastest time to write and send an e-mail of just under a minute (56 seconds),

45

while BigScreenLive and Eldy took twice as long, 122 and 136 seconds respectively (F (2, 23) =
7.58, p = 0.0029). Reasons for the time difference are further explored in Section 5.6. Reading a
new e-mail was also faster on the PointerWare system (F (2, 25) = 2.34, p = .1162), taking an
average of only 11 seconds, while BigScreenLive and Eldy took 53.5 and 46.5 seconds,
respectively. Printing an e-mail took 3-5 seconds using Pointerware and Eldy, but 33 seconds
using BigScreenLive (F (2,28) = 1.79, p = .184). Lastly, adding a bookmark took almost 2
minutes (112 seconds) using Eldy, less than a minute (46 seconds) using PointerWare, and 72
seconds using BigScreenLive (F (2, 21) = 3.88, p = .0366).

Figure 36: Average Time on Task

The reason for the above time discrepancies may be attributed to lack of visual cues.
PointerWare has an image of a printer next to the word “Print”, and an image of a folder next to

46

the words “Save Site”. When participants had to increase text size, several did not immediately
recognize the plus and minus signs with the magnifying glasses in PointerWare; one participant
remarked, “I wasn’t sure exactly what the plus and minus meant, I was thinking numbers rather
than size, but I took a guess and it was the only thing I could pick so it worked.” Adding a
bookmark in Eldy was a struggle because the majority of participants did not recognize the star
symbol. According to Figure 37, only half of all Eldy users were able to add a bookmark. One
participant remarked that it should just say the word “Bookmark” next to the button because
there is no way she would have ever known what the star symbol meant. It would be beneficial
and eliminate confusion if words such as “Print” and “Home” had symbols next to them. Eldy
and BigScreenLive have hover-over text for the different buttons, but participants, particularly
novices and those unfamiliar with features like this, did not know about it and struggled to find
out the meaning of the buttons without clicking them. One participant said she hesitated to click
a button she thought was correct, “Sometimes I’m afraid to get further and further away from
where I was, because I don’t know how to get back.”
The last observation about this chart is that there is no bar for Eldy under deleting an email because not a single participant could successfully complete the task. To delete an e-mail
using one of the other programs required clicking a button on the same page as the e-mail being
read. However, if a participant is reading a new e-mail in Eldy, there is no accessible delete
button on the page. There is a delete button on the new e-mail page that shows all of the new emails before they have been read. Often participants would go back to the new e-mail folder after
reading the e-mail, see the delete button and click it, thinking they had deleted the e-mail. They
would not notice that the e-mail they had read was no longer in the folder, and that they had to
go to the ‘mail read’ folder to delete the e-mail, taking several steps. It is unclear if it is the
intention of the developers to make it more difficult to delete an e-mail; perhaps they are of the

47

mindset that e-mails
mails should never be deleted and everything should be kept. While this is one
way of thinking, itt is my belief that a user should have control over ttheir
heir inbox, and should be
able to easily delete any junk mail that slips through, or ee-mails
mails they simply do not want to save
for other reasons. Also, since Eldy does not have the ability to create folders to store e-mails
e
in
categories, participants just have
ave one long list of ee-mails
mails accumulating and it adds frustration to
have to take multiple steps to delete an ee-mail that is currently being read.

6.2 Error Summary
It is important to see if certain tasks have more frequent and/or serious errors than others.
In order to measure error frequency and severity for each task, or subtask, I defined error type as
follows. Minimal errors are minor and require limited intervention. For instance, if a participant
does not see something on the page or is getting frustrated, I may point them to look around the
whole page, or I may have to step in and reassure under-confident or overwhelmed participants
to just take their time. Sometimes people would be unsure and voice their questions out loud but
continued on their own. If a participant would get stuck and need me to hint at something or
point out one thing, that would go into the minimal category. Moderate error or interference
occurs when a participant is doing something wrong and is unable to proceed without more than
one intervention. If a participant needed me to comment two or three times to get them through a
task, that would be considered moderate intervention. A participant may be in the 'incomplete'
category for a number of reasons. Sometimes they give up and just do not know what to do, or
get stuck and a series of wrong steps lead them to be unable to complete the task. Other times
they cannot do the task in the allotted time period, needing a significant level of interference. If I
need to step in more than two or three times for the participant to get past the error, or it feels
like I have to guide them through every other step, the task is judged incomplete since more than
a moderate level of interference is required. Some participants were unable to complete tasks due
to a combination of time limit and lack of the knowledge they needed to know to get through the
task. Some novice participants had trouble controlling the mouse, using the touch screen, typing
and editing text, and controlling the blinking cursor, making it difficult to complete the task in
the allotted time period. See Section 8.1 in the appendix for a more thorough descriptive list of
errors for each program. Figure 41 below shows a comparison of error severity among the three
programs, with number of participants on the y axis.

The most notable errors were the following:
-

Eldy: The majority of participants (8) had minimal errors adding an address to the

address book. Participants would click on the blank text space under ‘Name’ instead of the ‘Add
a new person to your address book’ button. Novice participants who would not know to look for
a blinking cursor would try to click in the text box and just start typing, wondering why no text
was appearing (See Figure 42 below for reference).

Figure 42: Address book in Eldy
Users also had trouble with deleting an e-mail (no participants were able to complete this
task using Eldy), which is discussed in Section 6.1. There was also more trouble adding a
bookmark and locating a saved bookmark using Eldy than the other two programs. The biggest
problem was participants’ lack of familiarity with the star symbol that stands for bookmarks. The
next concern was locating a saved bookmark and getting back to the ‘portal’. Participants would
not recognize the word ‘portal’ as being the main Internet browsing page they enter when they
initially click on Internet, and had trouble figuring out how to get to it. More than half of

51

participants (6) also clicked on the star again to view bookmarks, without understanding that
they were adding another bookmark. A minor inconsistency that 7 of the 11 Eldy participants
were confused by was the cursor being set in the middle of the text bar by default when entering
a name for the added bookmark. Participants would try to move the blinking cursor to the
beginning of the text bar, and this inconsistency confused them.
The trouble participants had with navigation is discussed further in Section 5.5, but it is
worth mentioning some specific errors to get a better understanding of where people got stuck.
The biggest problem observed while participants performed tasks was transitioning from the email task to the web browsing task, or vice versa. In particular, participants had trouble
remembering what I would call the hierarchy of pages within Eldy. When a participant wanted to
go to the home screen, or what Eldy calls the ‘Square,’ there was no one-click button to do this.
At the bottom of the page, there is a centered button that displays different text depending on
where within the program a user currently is. Numerous participants clicked ‘exit’ to try to get to
the ‘Square,’ unsure of what to do. Several participants clicked the lifeboat (help) on the upper
right hand corner of the page, but were either reluctant to go further and look at the tutorial, or
clicked on tutorial and saw a section in Italian (since the program was developed in Italy, part of
the help section is written in Italian), or they would find the section they were looking for, but
they would click on the reference images within the tutorial which would not result in any action
or take them where they expected to be taken. When participants did see the ‘back to the square’
button at the bottom of a page, they did not recognize what ‘square’ meant and would not know
to click it. Lastly, participants struggled with writing and sending an e-mail, which is discussed
in Section 5.6. The flow of steps it takes to complete the task is confusing to users, as confirmed
by the high number of mouse clicks needed to accomplish the task (shown in Figure 30, Section
5.6).

52

-

PointerWare: The biggest area for errors in PointerWare was adding an address to the

address book. Approximately half of participants (5 out of 11) had minor or moderate issues
completing this task, with three unable to complete the task. Upon clicking the ‘New Person’
button when prompted “Whom are you writing to?,” three participants clicked on the ‘add email’ button before adding an e-mail address in the text box. This would take them to an error
message page, saying “Invalid mail address”. This type of error could be attributed to not
carefully reading the directions. One participant had an extra space before the e-mail address,
and could not figure out why she was getting to the error page. Perhaps if the error message
could be more descriptive, it would cause less confusion. Two participants saw the “Whom are
you writing to?” prompt and instead of clicking ‘New Person,’ they clicked in the big empty
square and started to type, a more minor error. See Figure 43 below for reference.

Figure 43: PointerWare address book
Another issue that came up a few times during the internet task was scrolling. There is an
up button and a down button used to scroll on the page. Participants had trouble conceptualizing
that the ‘up’ arrow moves the actual page down, and the ‘down’ button moves the page up. Also,
these buttons move the page at a defined interval with each click, making smooth scrolling hard
and often cutting off the page in awkward places. Participants who used a computer before,
expected a scroll bar on the right, which did not consistently appear.

53

-

BigScreenLive: More than half of participants (6) had minimal errors adding an address

to the address book and (7) had minimal errors adding a bookmark. The biggest concern with the
address book had to do with the layout of the page. Participants had no trouble locating the
address book and saw the tab right away, clicking on it. However, after they did this, they saw
the words “No data available” in the address book and tried to click on it, tried to delete the
words to write the contact information, and wanted to get rid of “No data available.” There is a
button that says ‘add new name’ on the right side of the page, but since people read from left to
right, they would get stuck on the left side of the page without seeing the button on the right.
The difficulty with adding a bookmark for most participants was confusion over ‘our
favorites’, ‘family favorites’ and ‘my favorites’. Since the ‘my favorites’ tab was open when
participants were browsing, it is possible they did not realize that clicking on that tab (that
already looks like it is open) will change the screen. Participants would click on the ‘our
favorites’ tab instead of ‘my favorites’. See Figure 44 below for reference.

Figure 44: Web browsing in BigScreenLive, “My Favorites”, “Family Favorites”, and “Our
Favorites” tabs at the top
A navigational issue that participants came across using BigScreenLive was transitioning
from one part of the program to the other. For instance, when a participant wanted to go from email to web browsing, they did not know how to do this. Several participants wanted to minimize

54

the screen after using e-mail to get back to web browsing, not realizing how navigation worked.
When participants were looking for bookmarks, several people went to tools and needed to get
back to the web browsing page, but when they went back, the page they were on would
disappear and they were on the initial search page. This confused them: they thought that they
had to perform the whole search over again, not realizing that their previous search results were
saved and that there is a small back arrow button that would take them back through their
actions. One participant clicked on the ‘clear’ button in the e-mail part of the program, thinking it
would clear the page so she could go to e-mail. However, the ‘clear’ button was meant for
clearing the text in the body of the e-mail. From the home page, users are quick to locate e-mail
and Internet because the buttons of the left side of the screen have both a picture and text next to
them. However, when a user is on any other page, the text that was next to those same
navigational buttons disappears and they have more trouble navigating. See Figure 45 below for
reference.

7 Conclusion
All of the programs had an overall positive impact on the participants. In every case,
confidence grew upon using the programs; overall, people had positive experiences and were
satisfied with the design of the programs. Figure 32 and Table 5 in Section 8.3 show how the
level of comfort after using the programs increased for all three programs as well, showing that
these programs have a profound impact on how comfortable senior citizens feel using computers.
Time-on-task measurements and user comments suggest the importance of combining
text and image cues in an interface. Time-on-task and mouse click counts suggest the superiority
of flat (non-hierarchical) organization of page layout that avoid pop-up windows. Survey
responses indicated an overall preference for the combination approach, using a touch screen
interface in conjunction with mouse and keyboard. The touch screen was particularly beneficial
for those with hand difficulties. Finally, consistent interface elements help ensure users know
where they are within a program, eliminating a great deal of confusion.
The list below serves as a list of recommendations based on observations from the study.
1. Interface: Having a flat interface as opposed to one with any kind of layers or pop-up
boxes is the least confusing for novice users. This is confirmed by looking at the time it
took to add an address to an address book using the program BigScreenLive, which had
a pop-up window come up to type the contact information in. Because of some
confusion participants had reading directions on the pop-up window and on the layer
behind it, it look longer for participants to complete the task using BigScreenLive than
using the other two programs (see Figure 36). A suggestion would be to embed any popup windows so that there are no layers created.
2. E-mail: Several participants mentioned that they need to have spell check available
when they are typing. One participant who had used e-mail before said that she would

56

type e-mails in a word processing program just to use the spell check feature, then copy
and paste them into an e-mail. It would be helpful to have a spell check feature for
people to utilize when writing e-mail.
3. Web browsing: When participants were presented with a search bar, they knew to type
what they were looking for into it. In Eldy, there is a URL bar that confuses people who
do not know what a URL or web address is and what a search term is. The URL bar in
Eldy does not allow users to type in search terms, it is only for web addresses. Some
participants were not familiar with search engines like ‘Google’ either. It is my
recommendation that the Internet page have a simple search bar with a direction
instructing the user to type what they are searching for into the box, while allowing them
to type in a web address as well. In addition, it might make sense to have a bookmarks
button that adds a bookmark but also shows a list of saved bookmarks, since users will
often click on the same button they clicked to add a bookmark, to also view their saved
bookmark.
4. Navigation and Visual Cues: It is critical for a user to know where they are within a
program. Consistency and symbols a user can recognize and recall rather than remember
are very important. I suggest that there be a recognizable ‘Home’ button in the same
place on every page a user visits. I also suggest that every button (to the extent possible)
have both text and a clear symbol. It is not enough to simply have a picture of a printer
or a symbol of a star for bookmarks, but it should explicitly say the words “Print” and
“Bookmark” next to the proper symbols. Printing is ranked one of the most useful
features (see Figure 33) so it is important that people can find the button to do this
without frustration.

57

5. Touch screen vs. mouse and keyboard: It was observed over the course of the study
that users had an overall preference to using a combination of touch screen, as well as
mouse and keyboard. The touch screen was particularly helpful for those with hand
difficulties (including tremors, trouble moving fingers, numbness, and so on).
Participants who are used to using a mouse, and comfortable with it, do not have as
strong of a need for a touch screen. The populations that most benefit from the touch
screen are novice participants and those with any difficulty controlling a mouse.
These findings support the recommendations given by the National Institute on Aging
and the National Library of Medicine [8, 10], which emphasize the importance of a clear,
consistent layout, with buttons incorporating both text and images. In addition, these results
are consistent with recommendations from the U. S. General Services Administration and
the U. S. Department of Health and Human Services [22] that encourage discontinuing the
use of pop-up windows or graphics. With emerging touch screen technologies such as ipads
and touch phones dominating the minutest of activities in our daily lives, it is important to
consider accessibility for senior citizens in our increasingly complex, technologically
dependent society. However, with this area of research being given more attention, we are
well on our way to making a more simply integrated modern world.

the computer and said 'type'. She said it 3 times. When she got no response, she thought

but didn’t see a change in the text size, and didn’t know she did it right. "it confused me,
there must be some better way of communicating text size- smaller and larger, maybe it
needs a label like you have this for up and this for down. The magnifying glass is not
helpful but if there was a block that said text size, and a plus or minus that would be
helpful."

down. (not on 1 line). Participant didn’t know what to do so I explained it to her: just 1
address on the line. I showed her how to do it, but got invalid message again because
there was a space after and before the e-mail.

recognize the drop down.

read the e-mail, she was surprised. She read the direction that said to select a blue
highlighted message, and then opened it and got to the letter.
- Participant clicked ‘get new mail’, but didn’t know she had a new e-mail. She didn’t
know the blue highlighted message was new. I guided her to read directions, then she did
the right thing and opened e-mail.

was a button with a picture of a printer because she gave up.

8.2 Survey Responses to Open Ended Questions
Below are some users’ responses to two open ended questions asked on the post-survey.
8.2.1

If you are not currently a regular user, what has kept you from using a computer?

“For one thing, most people my age don’t have a lot to look up. We're from a different
generation where we look things up with an encyclopedia. Most people my age don't
have e-mail, we just pick up the phone or write a letter. When I have used it, sometimes I
get stuck and frustrated, and stop. I haven't used it in years. It’s a different form of
communication.”
“I don’t understand them at all. I have no idea what to do, and don’t know the phrases. I
don’t know the terminology, what all of the ‘thingymabobs’ mean. I have no clue what
anything means.”
“I gave my computer away, and have none now. I just wasn’t doing much with it. I
recently ordered a laptop.”
“First I didn’t have a computer, then my friend gave me one and now I’m in the process
of hooking it up.”
“It just seems complicated to me, and I have to sit and wait all of the time.”
“Partially it’s time. Nobody has dedicated time to teaching me the computer. I had a
computer at home but it was slow, patience is not one of my virtues. I do enjoy it when I
do go on the computer, I can’t believe so many hours have passed, that I’ve been on it for
that length of time.”
“I don’t understand it. Everything has kept me from using it.”
“I’m just really not into it. I had to use it at work. I took a computer class at the high
school and remembered a lot of stuff but didn’t practice it, so I only use it for games.”
“I use the computer to write up notes from meetings. I do a little e-mail but I just don’t
know how to do anything else.”
“I wanted to use the Microsoft word tutorial, it is on the computer. I can’t take notes
because my tremor makes my handwriting illegible. I would have to remember every new
instruction from the tutorial, it was too hard. I did use one of my son’s computers to find
things on the web and enjoyed it.”
“I play games. I have tried to use the internet but I get to a certain point and get
frustrated, and I end up finding nothing out.”
“I really don’t want one. I worked with a computer in the past, and had one at home but
got so sick of the computer. I’m trying to live on the periphery of technology, it’s not that
easy. My daughter gave me a laptop a year ago, it is still sitting, not connected.”

“I don’t use it that often, just for looking things up. I do e-mail the grandkids but that’s
all. I have the basics of it. Dial up is slow and I don’t have time to wait for it.”
“I am intimidated because I don’t know many things about how to use it.”
“I don’t find them that friendly. I also want to be comfortable and sit with my feet up, I'm
not so comfortable sitting up. I watch tv with my feet up.”
“I rarely use a computer, maybe once or twice a month. The printer is not working; there
are problems with set up. I am also very busy.”
If you have used a computer before, what do you find most confusing or frustrating
about using a computer?

“Finding my way around the computer, I could get online but right now I don't know
how.”
“Sometimes I find e-mail confusing, it’s really my impatience. I want it to be clearer right
away. I want a step by step description. I worry about viruses too.”
“Understanding some of the confusing instructions my computer gives me when I am
doing something wrong. Directions disappearing too quickly before I can read them.”
“I find that the text is too small, and I have to put my glasses on and off depending on
what the text looks like. I often follow the tv and they say ‘go to this’ and ‘go to that’,
and I just can’t remember what they say because it goes so fast. They say go to a link and
I can’t find it, I don’t know what it is, where does it say "link"? One thing I never learned
to do is download, I have no idea what it means or how to get it, whether it’s finished or
not finished.”
“The chatroom and facebook. I know there are things the computer can do but not how to
do them: banners and flyers, spreadsheets and banking. Spyware and risks, what I need to
protect my information. Cleaning out the computer of errors and whatnot, that is on the
foreign side, and whether or not to trust companies that offer to clean out the computer to
make it work faster and to find out whether I should update it- if it’s worth it or if the one
I have is sufficient for my needs. My computer had things on it that disappeared and I
don’t know how, when or where. I think it was changing service providers. Spell
checking is more annoying now, and I have dyslexia so spell check is really important.”
“You can’t just turn it on and begin using it as you could with the word processors. The
computer wants to know: did you do this? Did you renew this? Do you want to change
this? Etc. etc.”
“Utilizing Microsoft word, email connection, address book, getting an address onto a
greeting card by printing, exporting and importing photos”
“Pasting, sending an attachment in an email, printing photos and organizing photos on
my computer”
“I get frustrated when I can't find what I'm looking for, not that I've done it very often. I
have a computer in my house, my daughter and son in law use it, and grandkids use it all
of the time.”

“If I’m looking something up and it tells me to go somewhere else, I have to lose
whatever I have on the screen”
“Things not coming up quickly, a lot of pop-ups that interfere. I upgraded my speed and
it’s not working. Trying to look up certain things, you have to be persistent and I get a
little impatient. If you don’t use the exact word or phrase you can’t find it. When people
send me things, a lot of times I can’t open them, and that’s probably my security system.
I’m always concerned about things that you have to download, I'm not sure and I don’t
want to get a virus. Sometimes you have to sign license agreements and I'm not crazy
about that. Adobe reader keeps asking to upload, and I'm used to that. Anytime it asks me
to sign an agreement, I usually cancel.”
“I had a terrible time trying to get help. Adobe reader came out with an update and now
nothing appears in my print queue when I try to print.”
“I have trouble with my elements program (fixing photos) for photography. Sometimes
when it freezes I have a problem. I don’t know the differences between a pc and mac, I
have total unfamiliarity.”
“Not knowing how to fix problems from here to there, and setting up the computer”
“I basically just play games. I do get e-mails on my son in law’s computer and I know
how to go to the food channel for recipes, just simple things.”
“Not being able to find what you’re searching for”
“Things change on the computer which always surprises me. I’m writing a manuscript
and I went to Microsoft, but the icons changed where they were on the screen. Any
changes without explanation confuse me. The unknown confuses me.”
“I don't think I could just keep hitting the keys and going through programs, I get various
error messages. I understand you can’t really hurt a computer, but I worry about that.”
“I don’t know whether my computer needs a spell at genius bar. I have very uneven
response, sometimes I can’t open my email, sometimes I have to shutdown & open again,
other times its fine. I have a Macintosh and it’s almost as if the mac’s intuition does
things that I’m not controlling. As I said before, what’s confusing is that I don’t have
consistent idea of where my various files are, its hit or miss when I go back and open
some of the things I have downloaded. Not really organized in a way I can reference
them (contacts in files).”
“The slowness of it, and because I have an old computer they keep asking me to update
my browser which I can’t because I don’t have the money to buy a new computer.
Change/update browser (windows 98) popping up. I purchased a secondhand laptop that I
couldn’t get going, I got frustrated, used other peoples laptops.”
“When the server goes down, using word, keeping files in order”
“Some things were confusing, mainly dealing with the internet”
“It has been 2 years since I used it. I couldn’t get on my yahoo mail. I had trouble
figuring out the numbers and letters [captcha] and my daughter had to help me. Getting
on word processing was confusing”
