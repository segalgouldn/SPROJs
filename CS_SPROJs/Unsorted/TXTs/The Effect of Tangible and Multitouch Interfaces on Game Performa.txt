Abstract

Over the past few years, the video game industry has seen an explosion of innovative
new interfaces. From touch-based mobile games on the Apple iPhone and Nintendo DS
to console titles on the Nintendo Wii and Xbox Kinect requiring players to physically
move around their living rooms, the definition of ‘video game controls’ has expanded far
beyond the traditional controller. Although such novel control schemes have been met with
unarguable commercial and critical success, little research has been done to explore the
eﬀectiveness of these interfaces from the standpoint of user performance: we do not know if
touch- and tangible-based interfaces make us better gamers, or to what extent they might.
This paper explores this question, specifically looking at how such interfaces can improve
player performance by providing a more natural and direct means of interacting with the
game and by enabling players to multitask more eﬃciently in-game. To accomplish this, a
game was developed for the Apple iPad that was designed to be controlled in three diﬀerent
ways: a traditional joystick interface, a multi-touch interface, and a tangible interface
with a physical game piece, each with optional multitouch gestures. A custom automated
analytics system was built on top of the game, allowing quantitative performance data to
be gathered from user testing sessions held with Bard students.

Introduction

Until relatively recently, video game controls had been largely unchanged since the proliferation of the first generation of video games in the early 1980s. The number of buttons
had increased, and the ergonomic shape of controllers had certainly improved, but with a
few notable exceptions the fundamental paradigm of a plastic controller with buttons and
a directional pad or joystick remained a constant.
The past few years, however, have seen an explosion of new game interfaces depending
on tangible and multitouch input. The wild commercial success of Nintendo’s DS and Wii
consoles and the increasing popularity of Apple’s iOS App Store as a gaming platform as of December 2010, the Wii has sold 84.64 million units worldwide1 to the Playstation
32 and the Xbox 360’s3 50 million each, despite the Xbox 360 having been released a full
year earlier than the Wii - are clear indicators that these new interfaces have been widely
accepted by gamers of all kinds.

1. INTRODUCTION

Despite this surge in popularity, little to no research has been done on the eﬀectiveness
of these new interfaces; while there is a wealth of user interface research on tangible and
multitouch interfaces in traditional computing, it has yet to be shown that moving away
from a traditional game controller has a practical eﬀect on gaming beyond attracting
consumer interest.
This project explores the eﬀect these new mechanisms of controlling games have on
player performance. In short, it is trying to answer the question of whether the way a gamer
physically interacts with a game aﬀect their ability to succeed at the game. Specifically, this
project uses a twin-stick shooter developed for the Apple iPad to target two facets of this
question: the ways in which traditional, multitouch, and tangible controls each aﬀect player
performance, and how each of these interfaces aﬀects usage of multitouch gestures designed
as a simultaneous secondary input. Through qualitative interviews and quantitative ingame analytics data gathered from test sessions, this project aims to provide an increased
understanding of how players respond to diﬀerent levels of tactility and direct manipulation
in game interfaces, with the hope that it will aid game designers to come up with more
successful innovative game interfaces in the future.

1.1 Tangible Game Interfaces
The best-known example of tangible interfaces in gaming today is the Wii gaming console,
released by Nintendo in 2006. Instead of using a standard video game controller, the
system features a wireless remote control-like device outfitted with accelerometers and
an infrared sensor. Although it can be modified using its expansion port to gain the
same number of buttons and joysticks one would find on a more standard modern game
controller, many games take advantage of the motion sensors to provide what could be
described as tangible game experiences. In Nintendo’s title Wii Sports (bundled with the
Wii hardware), players are asked to swing the Wii Remote as one would a tennis racket

1. INTRODUCTION

9

while playing the Tennis game, or mimic the actions of throwing it like a bowling ball in
the Bowling game. The Wii has been both a critical and commercial success for Nintendo.
However, it is diﬃcult to show decisively that the success of the Wii is due to its more
physically engaging control scheme than to one of a multitude of other factors (Nintendo’s
aggressive marketing campaign, a library targeted at a wider audience of ‘casual’ gamers,
etc).
The Wii games considered to use motion-based controls the most eﬀectively are, generally speaking, not playable using a conventional control scheme. Their closest non-motion
competitors tend to diﬀer greatly in feature sets and core game mechanics. Conventional
tennis games, for example, allow the player to move around freely and to accurately aim
each shot with precise button controls, almost as if they were programming the outcome.
Since it is so easy to control where your shot lands, the challenge comes largely from
moving your player around the court appropriately. Wii Tennis, in contrast, controls the
characters for the player, but the outcome of each shot is determined by the manner and
timing in which the player swings their Wii Remote. The basic challenge of the game
comes not from moving to the ball, but in hitting the ball the precise right way. The
same can be said of touch-based interfaces; the most commercially successful iPhone and
Android games tend to be the ones whose controls focus on direct manipulation of the
game elements using multitouch.

1.2 Touch-Based Interfaces
Touch-based interfaces have been around for decades, although they have traditionally
been used primarily for mobile devices. Perhaps popularized with the Apple Newton in
1994 and then the PalmPilot in 1997, the first generations of touch-based devices relied on
pressure-based resistive touch detection, and almost universally relied on a stylus for input.

1. INTRODUCTION

10

Although the Palm platform found some minor success as a game device, the Nintendo
DS was the first mainstream success using this sort of technology for gaming.
More recently, Apple’s iOS devices and other touch-based smartphones have gained
popularity as gaming devices. The iPhone and iPad detect touches using electrical capacitance, rather than pressure. This has two practical eﬀects. First, a stylus is unwieldy, as
all touches need to come from an organic source or capacitive material connected to an
organic source. While this has not proved a major technical issue for stylus manufacturers
(in South Korea, frozen sausages have skyrocketed in sales recently as iPhone users found
they were eﬀective in controlling their phones in the cold weather), this design decision
encourages a model of direct manipulation, with users touching user interface elements on
the screen directly rather than using an intermediary object such as a stylus.
Secondly, capacitive-based touchscreens allow for multitouch. Each iOS device can detect up to 11 simultaneous unique touch points, as opposed to the one allowed by resistive
screen technology. Research studies have suggested that multitasking using multiple hands
(as in a multitouch iOS device) is more eﬃcient: a 1986 study found that asking users to
multitask with a two-handed input system resulted in better performance from both novice
and advanced users, as well as a lessened skill gap between novice and advanced users[2].
Furthermore, a 2009 study conducted at the University of Massachusetts Lowell found that
100% of test participants asked to perform gestures to control robots used multi-hand gestures without any prompting; while users with iPhone experience were significantly more
likely to use gestures found in iOS such as the pinch gesture, this propensity towards
multitasking was universal among test participants[7].
Given the prevalence of studies such as these, it would appear that there is something
inherently appealing about multitouch interfaces. While such research has not previously
been performed in the field of gaming specifically, it is not hard to see how multitouch

1. INTRODUCTION

11

interfaces might be used to make interfaces that allow gamers to perform better without
an increase in innate skill.

1.3 Twin-Stick Shooters
The game designed for this project is a ‘twin-stick shooter’, a genre that originated in 1982
with the arcade title Robotron: 2084 but has since seen a comeback on the iOS platform.
While most arcade games in the early 1980s featured large scrolling levels, Robotron placed
the player inside a fixed game space with unlimited incoming waves of enemies. Instead
of the then-standard control scheme of a single joystick for movement and a fire button,
it featured two joysticks, allowing the player to fire in a direction other than the one the
character was moving in. These design considerations became the hallmarks of the genre:
nearly all twin-stick shooters place the player in a fixed space with the goal of killing as
many enemies as possible before either the player dies or a fixed amount of time elapses,
and give the player the ability to independently control their character’s movement and
direction of fire.
Recently, twin-stick shooters have become one of the most heavily represented genres
on both the iPhone and iPad App Stores, an impressive achievement given that games
are arguably the largest emerging market on the iOS platform. With a few notable exceptions, almost all of these iOS twin stick-shooters share a common control scheme: two
on-screen ‘virtual joysticks’ that players manipulate as if they were physical joysticks (a la
Robotron). It is interesting that, despite the range of expression possible with Apple’s multitouch interface, twin stick shooter developers have chosen to closely emulate an interface
developed for a 1980s arcade game.

Design Considerations

Figure 2.0.1. Trigonometry Wars, a twin-stick shooter for the iPad.

2.1 Overview
Trigonometry Wars is a twin-stick shooter developed for the Apple iPad. Both the genre
of game and the ‘virtual joystick’ control scheme described in the previous section are
well-established in the iOS gaming community, serving as strong reference points to base
the study on. Furthermore, the wide possibilities aﬀorded by the multitouch surface of
the iPad mean there are a number of possible interfaces that can be explored that vary
greatly from each other and from the traditional ‘virtual joystick’ method.
The game places the player in control of a red triangle surrounded by a series of yellow
circle base points representing the players health. As enemies (colored squares) enter from

2. DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS

13

all sides of the screen and attempt to attack the players base points, the player is tasked
with destroying the enemies while evading their attacks.
Specifically, there are two kinds of enemies: pink squares and orange squares. The orange
squares are slower, but have more health and deal more damage. All enemies select one
base point to attack, and continually move towards that base point, damaging it when
they touch. When the base point being attacked is destroyed, the enemy randomly selects
a diﬀerent base point to attack.
Enemies are spawned in ten-second waves. Within a wave, the game tests every 0.7
whether it should spawn an enemy; the spawn probability increases with each wave, meaning that later waves have more enemies than earlier ones. When an enemy is to be spawned,
it is randomly chosen whether it is a pink or orange enemy. Each subsequent wave also
increases the speed, total health, and damage dealt by each enemy at a linear rate. Once
a player destroys all the on-screen enemies for a given wave, the player is given a brief
(three-second) break before the next wave begins spawning.
To destroy the enemies, the player has two attacks. In the twin-stick shooter tradition,
the players avatar shoots a continuous stream of bullets that can damage the enemies.
Furthermore, the player can drop a bomb by drawing a circle anywhere on the screen.
The bomb damages all enemies within the circles radius; the amount of damage dealt
is inversely proportional to the size of the circle, forcing players to balance the trade-oﬀ
between the number of enemies targeted versus how much they are damaged. The use
of bomb gestures is unlimited, with their relatively large damage compared to the weak
bullets encouraging players to use them as much as possible.
When an enemy or a base point is damaged or destroyed, the damaged object flashes
red and a sound eﬀect is played. There are five of these sound eﬀects in total (one each for
damaging and destroying an enemy or base point, and one for a successful bomb gesture),
all in a lo-fi electronic style evoking early arcade games. For further feedback, the player’s

2. DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS

14

current wave and score is displayed at all times. Score is accumulated by killing enemies:
a pink enemy is worth 200 points and an orange enemy 300.
Overall, the visual and aural aesthetic of the game is intended to be as nondescript as
possible to let the controls be the more noteworthy part of the experience. The particularly
large size of the players avatar (the area made up of the red triangle avatar and the circle of
base points amounts to a relatively significant portion of the total screen size) is designed
to encourage the player to move frequently, as the large size makes the player a particularly
easy target for the increasing number of enemies. The sharp diﬃculty curve that progresses
from wave to wave is intended to overwhelm the player to some extent, encouraging them
to make use of both their bombs and bullets to keep the enemies at bay if they were not
in the earlier levels. The unlimited use of the bombs is anotherkey point in guiding player
strategy, with all of these factors collectively hoping to encourage players to multitask as
much as possible by moving and using the gestures simultaneously.
The game’s control interface can be divided up into two aspects: the movement, and
the secondary multitouch ‘bomb’ gesture.

2.2 Movement
As described in Section 1.3, a defining characteristic of twin-stick shooters is the ability
to control the direction of firing independently of the direction of movement. Three control schemes were developed with these considerations in mind: a traditional dual-stick
interface, a multitouch interface, and a tangible interface.
It is worth noting that creating a game designed to be played with three very unique
interfaces is problematic; as mentioned in Section 1.1, the games generally considered to
use tangible and multitouch interfaces most eﬀectively are ones that use them in such a
way that the game would not be playable with a traditional controller. Such an approach
to design, while useful for creating interesting new game experiences, does not easily allow

2. DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS

15

for a quantitative comparison of interfaces. Subsequently, Trigonometry Wars has been
designed such that each method of movement appears well-suited to the twin-stick genre,
even if it is perhaps not the most innovative use of each interface.

2.2.1

Dual Stick

The first control scheme is the dual stick interface traditionally found in the game genre.
Two virtual joysticks are present on-screen at all times, one on the bottom-left corner of
the screen and one on the bottom-right. Figure 2.2.1 shows the location of each of these
joysticks on the game screen, as well as a visual demonstration of how each functions.
The bottom-right stick controls the attack angle: placing ones finger anywhere in the
circle causes the player avatar to turn and face the angle equivalent to where the finger
lies relative to the center of the circle.
The left joystick controls movement. After setting a finger down inside the circle, moving
in a direction causes the player avatar to move in that direction with a speed relative to
how far the finger has been moved. This is meant to more closely emulate an analog
joystick, where pushing harder in a direction causes more of an eﬀect.
The chief benefit of this control scheme is its familiarity, as it is a control scheme
that most players who would consider themselves gamers should be instantly at home
with. It also provides a clear distinction between movement and rotation, as the two
axes of movement are spatially diﬀerentiated. One potential weak point with this control
scheme is its higher level of abstraction – other than by gaming convention, manipulating
virtual joysticks would appear to have little relation to moving the on-screen character.
Additionally, it requires two hands to fully operate, meaning that performing secondary
gestures requires temporarily giving up some level of control.

2. DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS

Figure 2.2.1. Movement and rotation are controlled independently by two virtual joysticks.

2.2.2

One Finger

The second control scheme, as seen in Figure 2.2.2, is still based on touching the screen,
but does not rely on virtual joysticks. Tapping within the circle surrounding the player
avatar and then moving one’s finger controls both rotation and movement. Moving the
finger within a small radius of the triangle character results in the triangle turning in the
direction of the finger while staying stationary. Dragging the finger farther away from the
triangle results in it moving in the direction indicated by the finger, as if it is following
the finger.
This control scheme both oﬀers more direct manipulation of the avatar than the dual
stick control scheme and requires only one hand, allowing the player to perform gestures
with their secondary hand while still controlling movement and rotation. The clear limitation of this control scheme is that it does not allow simultaneous independent control of
movement and rotation. While it is possible to rotate without moving, one cannot move in
one direction while firing in a diﬀerent direction, a common tactic in twin-stick shooters.

2.2.3

Tangible Game Piece

The third and final control scheme is a tangible one. Rather than interacting with the
multitouch screen, the player moves around a physical game piece on the screen, with
the on-screen avatars location and rotation directly mirroring that of the game piece.
Technically, this is accomplished using capacitive foam and fabric glued to a knob-like
plastic cylinder approximately one inch in diameter (see Figure 2.2.3). On the base of
the piece are three pieces of capacitive foam arranged in an isosceles triangle formation;
all other visible surfaces of the game piece are covered in two large pieces of capacitive
fabric, with each piece of foam connected to these large pieces via smaller strips of fabric.
When the player moves the game piece, the capacitance in their fingers transfers through
the fabric and foam, causing the multitouch screen to register each foam piece as a touch
point. From there, it is trivial to calculate the position and angle of the game piece using
triangulation. A red triangle has been drawn on the top of the piece, showing the player

which direction the game piece is facing while providing an aesthetic link to the player’s
in-game avatar.

easily determine the front of the piece.

A potential advantage of this control scheme is the increased range of control aﬀorded
by the physical piece. It oﬀers the distinction between movement and rotation that the
dual stick controls oﬀer, but with the gestural freedom and sense of direct manipulation
aﬀorded by the second control scheme. It is also hypothesized that interacting with a
tangible object, rather than the flat screen, will cause players to be more engaged in the
game experience.
The drawbacks of the physical piece are also clear. The piece being used is relatively
large, and it is possible that it will obscure the players view of the screen. Additionally,
with a real-world object, real-world restrictions come into place; it is possible that the
player could knock over the piece and lose precious game time reorienting themselves in
the game, something that is not an issue with the previous control schemes.

2.3 Gestures
At the time of testing, Trigonometry Wars has one possible multitouch gesture: at any
time, the player can draw a circle on-screen and all enemies within the radius of the circle
will be damaged. An example of this can be seen in Figure 2.3.1, where two enemies are
killed with a single gesture.

2. DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS

Figure 2.2.4. The tangible interface in action.
Furthermore, the eﬀect of the gesture is aﬀected by the nature of the circle drawn.
The larger the radius of the circle, the less damage is dealt to enemies, forcing the player
to make a decision: a small focused circle can kill a weaker enemy in one attack, but
drawing a larger circle can do more widespread damage across many enemies (the number
of enemies aﬀected has no bearing on how much damage is dealt to each enemy). This
is designed specifically to take advantage of the nature of multi-touch interfaces, as the
way the gesture functions makes it impractical to implement on a game controlled via
traditional gamepad or keyboard and mouse.

Research Methodology

Testing participants were solicited from within the Bard community. Although the test
pool was limited to current Bard students at least 18 years of age, no eﬀort was made
to specifically target participants who would or would not identify as gamers, with the
expectation that the final group of participants would naturally contain members of both
demographics.
Participants underwent the test process individually, scheduled in half-hour time slots.
Each participant was asked a few preliminary interview questions, and then played the
game three times, spending five minutes on each control scheme, and being asked a series
of questions after each play. The sessions were video recorded, allowing interviews to be
conducted without any distraction caused by note-taking.

3.0.1

Pre-Play Interview

The following questions were asked of each participant before having them play the game.
The aim of these questions was to establish a basic profile of the participant to take into
consideration when assessing their game performance.

3. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY

1. Would you describe yourself as a gamer? If so, what genres of games do you like to
play?
2. What sort of experience with games do you have?
3. Any experience with twin stick shooters / tower defense?
4. Do you own an iPhone or an iPad? How about another multitouch smartphone?
5. Do you have any experience with iPad or iPhone gaming?
6. If so, can you give a few examples of your favorite game interfaces?
7. Are you left- or right-handed?

3.0.2

Explanation of the Game

After this first interview session, each player was given a brief description of the games
rules: each was told that they were playing as a red triangle, surrounded by a series of
yellow circles that represent their life points. They were then told that orange and pink
squares were going to come onto the screen and try to attack the life points. If a life point
was attacked enough times, it would die. If they all died, the participant would lose. The
participant was told to attack and kill the red squares with their gun to get points, and
the gun was always firing. Enemies would spawn indefinitely, only stopping if the player
died or when five minutes had elapsed.
After this, the first control scheme was explained to the participant, followed by the
gesture. They were told that at any time they could draw a circle on the screen to drop a
bomb, damaging everything inside the circle. It was explained that the larger the radius
of the circle, the less the damage, so they would have to deal with the trade-oﬀ between
attacking a large number of enemies weakly or dealing a more focused amount of damage to

a smaller number of enemies. They were encouraged to end the circle gesture at roughly the
same point they began it, as a means of helping the gesture recognizer function properly.

3.0.3

Playing the Game

They then spent five minutes each with the remaining two control schemes. The order in
which the interface methods were presented varied from participant to participant, chosen
in such a manner so as to ensure even distribution for each possible order combination; with
six possible configurations and thirteen test participants, this means that each arrangement
was presented to two diﬀerent participants, with one arrangement being presented a third
time. Furthermore, the games random number generator was set to a fixed seed, ensuring
that each player experienced the exact same enemy spawn rate pattern.
The analytics system created for the game tracked any notable in-game events, allowing
me to review each game session after the fact and analyze each players performance.
Whenever a notable game event occurs, the event was logged into a database, along with
the time it occurred (as a Unix timestamp), which control method was being used, a
key uniquely identifying the participant, and various pieces of pertinent data. Table 3.0.1
details the events logged and the data collected.

3. RESEARCH METHODOLOGY

24

The game sessions were video recorded, so that the analytics data could be crossreferenced with the video footage of the physical interaction between the participant and
the iPad; it was assumed that such data would prove useful in situations where correlating physical movement with in-game performance could be useful, such as if a participant
appeared to be having diﬃculty moving the tangible piece.

3.0.4

Post-Play Interview

After each game trial, the participants were asked about the easiest and most diﬃcult
elements of the control method they just used. After the third five-minute session, a
further series of questions were asked of the participants:
1. Which control format did you prefer? Why?
2. Which control format felt more natural?
3. How did you feel about the items that used multitouch gestures?
4. What aspects of the game were the most diﬃcult?
5. What aspects of the game were the easiest?
6. Was the game fun? Why do you think you enjoyed it?
The intent behind these questions was to provide insight into the players qualitative
experience playing the game; the in-game analytics would provide ample quantitative data
about how game performance varied from interface to interface, while this interview would
serve to explore the participants emotional reactions to the diﬀerent control methods.
It was suggested at this project’s midway board that the post-play questions be revised to generate more numerically quantifiable answers, including more pointed lines of
inquiry and an introduction of Likert scale ratings. A more specific set of questions was
re-submitted to the IRB, but a response was not received prior to testing.

Results

4.1 Interviews
Tables 4.1.1 and 4.1.2 aggregate the quantifiable interview questions asked of each participant before playing the game and after completing all three game sessions.

4.1.1

Prior Gaming Experience

While an overwhelming majority of participants did not describe themselves as ‘gamers’,
each participant reported having experience with multiple games of diﬀerent genres and
platforms. 10 of the 13 participants mentioned having played Pokemon, Nintendo 64,
or Playstation games when they were younger. 11 of the participants reported owning a
multitouch phone, and all 13 reported familiarity with at least one smartphone game (with
9 participants specifically mentioning the iPhone and Android game Angry Birds).

4.1.2

Preferred and Most Natural Interfaces

Table 4.1.3 displays the user-reported numbers for which interfaces were preferred and
which were considered the most natural, as well as how many participants scored highest
on each interface out of the three. While only one participant preferred the dual stick

4. RESULTS

26

interface, four described it as the ‘most natural’; when pressed, the four participants each
indicated that their choice was based on it being the most familiar of the control schemes,
since it was also the most conventional. Interestingly, three of these four participants did
not list any experience with the sort of games that would use a dual-stick control scheme,
and none of these three self-identified as a gamer.

4.2 Analytics
4.2.1

Data Analysis Methodology

The SQLite database containing all of the analytics data gathered during the testing
sessions (see Table 3.0.1) was entered into a custom-built statistical plotting application
written using JavaScript with the jQuery framework, the graphic library Flot, and HTML5
Local Databases. This allowed simple generation of tables and charts based on any pieces of
data taken from an individual participant or taken in aggregate over the set of participants.

4.2.2

Overall Performance

Table 4.4.1 shows the final score and number of gestures for each control scheme for each
participant, as well as the mean across all participants. Recall that points are rewarded
when enemies are killed, with the easier enemy type worth 200 points and the more diﬃcult
one worth 300. This punishes players who lost and had to restart the game partway through
a five-minute session, as the earlier waves have less enemies, making it more diﬃcult to
rack points quickly. Subsequently, the final cumulative score for a player represents roughly
how successful they were at an aggressive oﬀense, with a built-in penalty for failing to play
defensively enough.
Although it is clear in Table 4.4.1 that the mean final score for the tangible interface
was higher than that of the one finger interface, and both were in turn higher than the
dual stick interface, performing a one-way repeated-measure ANOVA test on the data

found the interface used to have no significant eﬀect on the mean final score (F (2, 24) =
3.07, p = 0.08, partial η 2 = 0.87). For this ANOVA test, Mauchly’s test did not show a
violation of sphericity against interface (W (2) = 0.93, p = 0.86). An alpha level of 0.05
was used for all statistical tests.

4.2.3

Performance Over Time

To paint a more complete picture of the relationship between each interface and the
participant’s scores, Figures 4.2.1 and 4.2.2 show how the mean score and number of
gestures used for each control method increased over the five-minute game period. Figure
4.2.3 shows the score over time for each individual participant.

4.2.4

Performance Over All Three Play Sessions

The bottom three rows of Table 4.4.1 show the average score and gestures for each interface
grouped by what order the participant played the game in. This corroborates a commonsense claim: as a participant plays the game, their skill will improve over time.
A one-way ANOVA test was performed on the final score for each play session grouped
by whether it was the first, second, or third play session for a participant. Mauchly’s test
did not show a violation of sphericity against play order (W (2) = 0.72, p = 0.16). With
one-way repeated-measure ANOVA, a significant eﬀect of play order on final score was
found (F (2, 24) = 8.21, p = 0.01, partial η 2 = 0.87). However, running a pairwise t-test
with Bonferroni correction on the data yielded p > 0.05 for all permutations.
Table 4.4.3 displays each participant’s set of final scores grouped both by interface and
order played, allowing easy comparison across any of these metrics. To help contextualize
this data, Table 4.4.2 shows the diﬀerence between a participant’s final score for a given
interface and the score they received on the first interface they played, with a value of 0
indicating that was the first interface the participant played.

4. RESULTS

30

The negative values that appear in Table 4.4.2 represent play sessions where the player
actually performed worse in that interface as their second or third play session than they
did on their first play session. It is perhaps worth noting that out of the six participants
who performed worse in a later play session than their first, only participants 10 and
11 scored worse using an interface that was not the dual-stick control scheme; those two
participants also have the distinction of being the only two participants who performed
better on their first play session than both of their subsequent sessions.

Gesture Usage by Interface

Looking at the mean gestures for each interface in Table 4.4.1, it is evident that participants
on the whole used more gestures with the one finger and tangible interfaces than with the
dual stick control scheme. As discussed earlier, common sense would indicate this to be
the case: the dual stick interface requires two hands to control movement and aim, making
performing gestures diﬃcult.
A one-way ANOVA test was performed on the number of gestures performed by each
participant for each interface. Mauchly’s test did not show a violation of sphericity against

interface (W (2) = 0.73, p = 0.18). With one-way repeated-measure ANOVA, a significant

4. RESULTS

33

eﬀect of interface on the number of gestures was found (F (2, 24) = 8.21, p < 0.01, partial
η 2 = 0.89).
Running a pairwise t-test with Bonferroni correction on the data yielded a p value of
1.00 for a comparison of the One Finger and Tangible interfaces. For the tests comparing
Dual Stick versus One Finger and Dual Stick versus Tangible, p = 0.08 and p = 0.01,
respectively.
Furthermore, running a similar one-way repeated-measure ANOVA test grouping the
gestures by the order of the play session showed no significant eﬀect of order played on the
number of gestures (F (2, 24) = 3.26, p = 0.07, partial η 2 = 0.75). As before, Mauchly’s
test did not show a violation of sphericity against interface (W (2) = 0.60, p = 0.06).
What can be said based on this statistical data is that participants used more gestures
using the tangible interface than the dual stick interface. Furthermore, the order of play
did not aﬀect the number of gestures used in a statistically significant way: that is, participants did not on the whole appear to increase their gesture usage as they became more
experienced at the game. One noteworthy exception to this can be seen in participant 4.

4.3 Further Analysis
4.3.1

Participant 4

Of all the participants, Participant 4 was by far the most proactive user of gestures. The
participant used 100 gestures with the dual stick control scheme, 209 with the tangible
finger, and 230 with the one finger interface; only two of the other twelve participants used
more than 100 gestures in any given play session, and no others even came close to using
100 gestures with the dual stick interface.
Looking further into Participant 4’s play habits reveal a number of other interesting
statistics. The participant’s final scores for the tangible and single-finger interfaces were
28,800 and 26,600, respectively; compared to the 23,000 scored with the dual stick inter-

4. RESULTS

34

face, this diﬀerence is relatively insignificant. The same can be said for the diﬀerence in the
number of gestures used: while there was relatively little diﬀerence between the number of
gestures used in the tangible and one-finger interfaces, fewer than half as many gestures
were used with the dual stick control scheme.
Most telling, however, is Participant 4’s behavior over time. Figure 4.3.2 shows the
participant’s gesture usage over the course of each play session. About 150 seconds in,
there is a sharp increase in the rate at which the participant used gestures with the dual
stick controls. After the 150-second mark, the participant uses gestures at roughly the
same rate as the other two control schemes. This makes logical sense when considered
with the participant’s total gesture usage: the increase in use came approximately halfway
through the dual stick session, and the number of gestures for that session is just under
half that of the other two sessions. Looking at the participant’s score over time (Figure
4.3.1) shows a similar pattern: shortly after 150 seconds, the participant’s rate of score for
the dual-stick scheme sees a marked increase, with the line roughly parallel to the lines
representing the other interfaces.
The most likely cause for this pattern becomes clear upon considering that the dual
stick control scheme was the first played by the participant. It would appear that about
halfway through the participant’s first game, the participant decided that using a significant number of gestures was a viable strategy. The participant then proceeded to use that
strategy for the second half of the current play session and the entirety of the next two
play sessions. The video footage from the play session gives credence to this theory: at a
time about a third of the way through the first play session (roughly corresponding with
the first marked increase in gesture use), the participant is heard commenting, “wow, it’s
so much easier!” immediately after killing a number of enemies with a series of gestures
in quick succession.

4. RESULTS

35

Also interesting to note is the eﬀect that the gestures had on the participant’s base points
in the dual stick control scheme. Looking at the participant’s base point loss over time in
Figure 4.3.3, the only time the participant lost any base points occurred while performing
gestures with the dual stick control scheme. Looking at the video footage, the participant
had diﬃculty juggling the two control schemes. The participant, who is right-handed,
only performed gestures with the right hand while playing with the dual-stick controls,
meaning that the participant was unable to move the character away from enemies while
performing gestures. Interestingly, while the participant continued to perform gestures
exclusively with the right hand when using the one finger interface (moving the character
with the left hand), the participant switched hands regularly while using the tangible
interface.

Participant 11

Participant 11 was one of only two participants to score highest on the first play session;
that is, rather than improving from play session to play session, participant 11 actually
performed worse over time. The participant’s three final scores were (in chronological
order) 27,300; 26,900; and 26,600. While these scores are close enough that it is unlikely the
participant got actively worse at the game, it is just as noteworthy that the participant’s
scores were all within 700 points of each other – as shown in Table 4.4.2, nearly every
other participant saw a much wider score gap between play sessions.
One possible explanation is that the participant was one of the more experienced gamers
in the study; out of the four participants who self-identified as gamers, participant 11 had
the most experience with games similar to Trigonometry Wars. Although the participant
claimed to be “bad” at twin-stick shooters, the participant was in fact the only one who
was familiar with the genre terminology and did not require further explanation when
asked about prior experience with twin-stick shooters. As such, the participant was more
instantly familiar with the way the game functioned; instead of having to master the
controls and the game system simultaneously, the participant was able to focus more of
his attention purely on the presented interfaces.
Reviewing the video footage from the participant 11’s test sessions reveals a few other
factors at play. Using the dual stick control scheme, the participant had diﬃculty successfully performing gestures. A large number of attempts were made that were not recognized
by the game as proper circles, almost certainly impacting the participant’s performance
and final score.
Perhaps most interesting was the participant’s interaction with the tangible control
scheme. Specifically, the participant consistently used the right hand to control the tangible
game piece and the left hand to perform gestures; out of the thirteen participants, a total of

4. RESULTS

38

four used this tactic rather than alternating hands based on the position of the game piece.
Out of the four participants who used the same hands throughout, all three performed
gestures with their dominant hand. Participant 11, however, used the dominant hand for
movement and the non-dominant hand for gestures. While this did not appear to aﬀect
the participant’s gesture usage in a negative way (the participant used more gestures using
the tangible interface than either of the other two), it is still very much worth noting.

clear actionable steps that could be taken to improve future work on this research.

4.4.1

Improved Tangible Hardware

One of the most frequent participant comments about the tangible game interface was the
lack of responsiveness of the game piece. Further explorations into tangible game interfaces
designed to interact with a capacitive touch screen would do well to improve upon both
the hardware and software used for this paper. Part of the responsiveness issues appeared
to be caused by the low-density capacitive foam used, which often required players to
exert significant pressure to get the screen to register the touch points. Upgrading to a
higher-quality foam such as is frequently used in commercial iPad styli would be likely to
greatly improve the responsiveness of the game piece.

4.4.2

Isolation of Gesture Components

A large portion of the ambiguity in the results of this study were due to being unable to
ascertain whether or not diﬀerences in performance were caused by the way the interfaces

4. RESULTS

40

encouraged or discouraged the usage of the multitouch gestures or rather a diﬀerent factor
present in the interface design. To more definitively determine causation, it would be to
illuminating to hold play sessions both with and without the gestures enabled, to see how
the relative performance between the interfaces varied whether or not the players were
asked to perform the secondary simultaneous gestures.

Recruitment Email (also to be used on Facebook / Bard Announce)
As some of you may already know, my senior project involves conducting usability testing on an iPad
game I've designed. My research is involved with measuring the effectiveness of novel new control
schemes versus traditional game interfaces.
It's testing time! I’m looking for people who want to come in and play the game and then answer a few
questions about it. The entire process will only take about half an hour. Basically, you get to help out
my project by having fun playing a game. What's not to like?
I'll be holding testing sessions at night on Wednesday, March 30, and all day Friday and Saturday April
1 and 2. If you're interested in participating, send me an email at mw562@bard.edu and we'll find a
half-hour time slot that works for you.
Thanks! Invite your (Bard) friends!

Consent Form
Project Title: The effect of tangible and touch-based interfaces on game performance
Researcher: Michael Walker
Faculty Adviser: Keith O’Hara
I am a student at Bard College, and I am conducting game play test sessions as an experiment for my
Senior Project. I am studying the effect that different novel interfaces have on the performance and
experience of playing a game.
During this study, you will be asked to play a video game using a few different control methods and
then answer a few questions about the experience. Please feel free to expand on the topic or talk about
related ideas. Also, if there are any questions you would rather not answer or that you do not feel
comfortable answering, please say so and we will stop the interview or move on to the next question,
whichever you prefer.
This entire process was designed to be approximately thirty minutes in length, and is not expected to
have any risk other than the minimal risks associated with playing any video game - eye strain, the
opportunity cost of your time, etc. The potential benefits include playing a new iPad game before its
release and helping influence its design, as well as contributing to video game development research to
create more immersive gameplay experiences.
All information will be kept confidential. I will keep the data in a secure place. Only myself and the
faculty supervisor mentioned above will have access to this information. Upon completion of this
project, all data will be destroyed or stored in a secure location.
Participant's Agreement:
I am aware that my participation in this play test session is voluntary. I understand the intent and
purpose of this research. If, for any reason, at any time, I wish to stop the play test session or
interview, I may do so without having to give an explanation.
The researcher has reviewed the individual and social benefits and risks of this project with me. I am
aware the data will be used in a Senior Project that will be publicly available at the Stevenson Library
on the Bard College Campus. I have the right to review, comment on, and/or withdraw information
prior to the Senior Project's submission. The data gathered in this study are confidential with respect to
my personal identity unless I specify otherwise. I understand if I say anything that I believe may
incriminate myself, the interviewer will immediately rewind the tape and record over the potentially
incriminating information. The interviewer will then ask me if I would like to continue the interview.
If I have any questions about this study, I am free to contact the student researcher (Michael Walker,
mw562@bard.edu, 858-353-3145) or the faculty adviser (Prof. Keith O’Hara, kohara@bard.edu,
845-752-2359). If I have any questions about my rights as a research participant, I am free to contact

APPENDIX B. DOCUMENTS SUBMITTED FOR IRB APPROVAL
the chair of Institutional Review Board: Prof. David Shein (IRB@bard.edu; shein@bard.edu,
845-758-7454).
I have been offered a copy of this consent form that I may keep for my own reference.
I have read the above form and, with the understanding that I can withdraw at any time and for
whatever reason, I consent to participate in today's interview.
